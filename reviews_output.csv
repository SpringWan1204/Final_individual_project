reviews Coiling Dragon.txt,"Where do I even start on this novel?it is famous for being a gateway to many many people to this subculture and medium including me.It has top-notch storytelling at the start and it suffers a bit at the later parts but has great quality overall.Linley Baruch is a great main character who may be a little bland at times. And side characters for select few aren't developed well and could feel like cardboard especially at the latter half of the novel.While in the world-building/' department, it is a great and even maybe the best way to enter this medium with more western and easier to grasp terms and sayings though IET has a bit of a running joke among fans as his descriptions can be a little...big and grand.All in all, I would extremely recommend this to new readers and strongly suggest veterans take a look too. While it may not reinvent the wheel, it has unique plot elements and great storytelling which make it a worthwhile read.","where do i even start on this novel?it is famous for being a gateway to many many people to this subculture and medium including me.it has topnotch storytelling at the start and it suffers a bit at the later parts but has great quality overall.linley baruch is a great main character who may be a little bland at times. and side characters for select few arent developed well and could feel like cardboard especially at the latter half of the novel.while in the worldbuilding department, it is a great and even maybe the best way to enter this medium with more western and easier to grasp terms and sayings though iet has a bit of a running joke among fans as his descriptions can be a little...big and grand.all in all, i would extremely recommend this to new readers and strongly suggest veterans take a look too. while it may not reinvent the wheel, it has unique plot elements and great storytelling which make it a worthwhile read."
reviews Coiling Dragon.txt,"Like many this was the first c-novel i ever read. I can honestly say this is a great novel that really showcases all of the tropes (good and bad) that come with these kinds of stories.The best part about this novel is the world building and the epic sense of scope and scale. This novel still has some of the best, if not the best, action sequences in any novel i have read to date. Absolutely dazzling and had me throwing my fist in the air at how awesome it wasLinley is great as a main character who forges his own path. His personality is a bit stale but he always remains likeable. The side characters tend to get lost in the shuffle becoming more of a mob type which is unfortunate.Overall i definitely recommend this if you're looking for a top tier action novel with epic world building.","like many this was the first cnovel i ever read. i can honestly say this is a great novel that really showcases all of the tropes good and bad that come with these kinds of stories.the best part about this novel is the world building and the epic sense of scope and scale. this novel still has some of the best, if not the best, action sequences in any novel i have read to date. absolutely dazzling and had me throwing my fist in the air at how awesome it waslinley is great as a main character who forges his own path. his personality is a bit stale but he always remains likeable. the side characters tend to get lost in the shuffle becoming more of a mob type which is unfortunate.overall i definitely recommend this if youre looking for a top tier action novel with epic world building."

Go on, go read it.*Sigh*I wish I could just end the review there and send you off on your merry way but the reviews demand a word count, ironically just like Chinese LN websites, so I will pad this review as best I can to hit the word count.The story is great, a young boy belonging to a now decrepit clan finds a ring and with it, sets out on a journey through dimensions filled with happiness, sorrow, love, loss and an unending desire to right the wrongs he and his family have experienced.

reviews Coiling Dragon.txt,"This is the one that got me into the entire genre. I started reading while it was still being translated and kept looking forward to the next release.During my first read through, there is nothing I would change or critic. After reading it a couple times afterwards, I realized some places it could be improved.The romance is very meh and kinda just there to be able to say there is romance in the novel.There are a couple of things that the author could've expanded on (Maybe having Linley teach his descendants his sculpting method, and more involvement with them in general.) and the ending also seems a little rushed.Despite that being said, the rest of the novel was GREAT, and I would highly recommend this novel to others, even if you've read it before..","this is the one that got me into the entire genre. i started reading while it was still being translated and kept looking forward to the next release.during my first read through, there is nothing i would change or critic. after reading it a couple times afterwards, i realized some places it could be improved.the romance is very meh and kinda just there to be able to say there is romance in the novel.there are a couple of things that the author couldve expanded on maybe having linley teach his descendants his sculpting method, and more involvement with them in general. and the ending also seems a little rushed.despite that being said, the rest of the novel was great, and i would highly recommend this novel to others, even if youve read it before.."

reviews Coiling Dragon.txt,"This is my number 1 favorite story ever on any site. This is the story that got me into Chinese light novels and so on. Honestly, there is nothing really bad about this story other than it's finished and I wish there was more for me to read.I am sure most readers of Chinese/Korean light novels have already read this and if someone has not then they need to stop reading whatever else they are reading and immerse themselves in this story.This story has it all, a great mc a great storyline. No harem and instead it has a beautiful love story that is not forgotten after a few chapters. It has great side characters and villains, and the cultivation in this story is amazing and easy to understand.The only thing I could really say that was kind like not so great was how certain abilities or should I say a cultivation style was pretty much like throwing out the window after a while. I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil anything but I remember myself and others feeling that it was kind of a let down that certain concepts were forgotten or just plain thrown away later on in the story.Of course, this did not ruin the story it just would have been great if they were kept in and developed.In conclusion, this is the best story hands down. The second best, in my opinion, would be The Desolate Era by the same author.","this is my number 1 favorite story ever on any site. this is the story that got me into chinese light novels and so on. honestly, there is nothing really bad about this story other than its finished and i wish there was more for me to read.i am sure most readers of chinesekorean light novels have already read this and if someone has not then they need to stop reading whatever else they are reading and immerse themselves in this story.this story has it all, a great mc a great storyline. no harem and instead it has a beautiful love story that is not forgotten after a few chapters. it has great side characters and villains, and the cultivation in this story is amazing and easy to understand.the only thing i could really say that was kind like not so great was how certain abilities or should i say a cultivation style was pretty much like throwing out the window after a while. i wont go into detail because i dont want to spoil anything but i remember myself and others feeling that it was kind of a let down that certain concepts were forgotten or just plain thrown away later on in the story.of course, this did not ruin the story it just would have been great if they were kept in and developed.in conclusion, this is the best story hands down. the second best, in my opinion, would be the desolate era by the same author."

reviews Coiling Dragon.txt,"God tier for this genre. Always will be the novel that got me into this genre, and I even reread it recently - still really good.The worldbuilding is excellent - for this genre, the worlds are almost ALL carbon copies of each other. Same political systems. Same cultures. Same sensibilities. Not this story. The geography is awesome, the enormity of the world feels real, the different cultural values can be seen, and the way the different *worlds* change as the story goes is very interesting. The starting culture Linley is born into resembles the European nobility system - which is very refreshing in this genre.Characters - The more I read this genre, the more I notice its flaws. All the young masters who are so arrogant and annoying, the beautiful women that only exist to turn the audience on or make them mad because another young master kidnapped the mc's ""property"". Not this. Coiling dragon has characters that have their own motivations, purposes, quirks, and so on that differentiate themselves from the rest of this genre. Not ONCE did I sigh and roll my eyes, thinking a fight was unnecessary or forced by the author. If there is a fight, there is a reason for it. Although not perfect, it's about as close as a story roughly two million (twenty standard novels) long, and translated from another language can be.As others have said, Linley can be a bit 'bland'. I would not necessarily agree, but I can still see where people are coming from. However, I have to rebut this point. Harry Potter, the character, not the book, is one of the blandest and most boring characters around. And yet, he is the MC of the most famous novel in the world. The reason? He allows the reader to easily put themselves int he MC's shoes. This makes the story almost become your own journey but in a different person's shoes rather than watching another person's story whom you may not agree with.Overall, there are flaws, but for this genre, you can easily overlook them. If you cannot, then you definitely won't last more than two story arcs of any other xianxia series. 10/10 WILL REREAD A THIRT TIME.","god tier for this genre. always will be the novel that got me into this genre, and i even reread it recently  still really good.the worldbuilding is excellent  for this genre, the worlds are almost all carbon copies of each other. same political systems. same cultures. same sensibilities. not this story. the geography is awesome, the enormity of the world feels real, the different cultural values can be seen, and the way the different worlds change as the story goes is very interesting. the starting culture linley is born into resembles the european nobility system  which is very refreshing in this genre.characters  the more i read this genre, the more i notice its flaws. all the young masters who are so arrogant and annoying, the beautiful women that only exist to turn the audience on or make them mad because another young master kidnapped the mcs property. not this. coiling dragon has characters that have their own motivations, purposes, quirks, and so on that differentiate themselves from the rest of this genre. not once did i sigh and roll my eyes, thinking a fight was unnecessary or forced by the author. if there is a fight, there is a reason for it. although not perfect, its about as close as a story roughly two million twenty standard novels long, and translated from another language can be.as others have said, linley can be a bit bland. i would not necessarily agree, but i can still see where people are coming from. however, i have to rebut this point. harry potter, the character, not the book, is one of the blandest and most boring characters around. and yet, he is the mc of the most famous novel in the world. the reason? he allows the reader to easily put themselves int he mcs shoes. this makes the story almost become your own journey but in a different persons shoes rather than watching another persons story whom you may not agree with.overall, there are flaws, but for this genre, you can easily overlook them. if you cannot, then you definitely wont last more than two story arcs of any other xianxia series. 1010 will reread a thirt time."

reviews Coiling Dragon.txt,"This novel is near and dear to my heart because it has several of my firsts. It is the first chinese webnovel I ever read, it is the first xianxia novel I ever read, it is the first wuxiaworld novel that I ever read, and I read it back when wuxia world was just started by Ren, and the whole translation scene was starting to pick up and there were barely any novels on this site. It is the first IET novel I ever read. It is also the first chinese webnovel that I finished. That's why I know that my view of the novel is biased but I genuinely loved the novel.Yes it does suffer from several of IET's tropes that he still has to this day in his novels. Mainly that there are several important side characters in the story that are completely forgotten, or that the story gets a bit repetitive at times and some of the statements made about the plot are forgotten/reversed. Also IET's exaggeration of distances and numbers to a point where they lose meaning (though if you read enough IET novels this becomes a bit endearing) and his sometimes faulty math is seen in this novel as well.That being said it also has several of IET's great qualities, such as gigantic worldbuilding even though we don't get to go to some of the places mentioned. Innovative cultivation systems with cultivators having different techniques that are based on their cultivation experiences, choices and aptitudes. Great action scenes that leave you satisfied and aren't hard to follow. Amazing techniques that sound and look cool. Hardworking MC that genuinely loves to cultivate and has an amiable character. And this novel specifically also has a story that goes over the pain of a broken heart and how to channel that into productive means without retaining hatred for that person or going after them. The emotions at certain points are also great and touching.Overall I would say this is my second favorite IET novel, just behind LXY, mainly because I really liked Xue Ying's insistence on protecting the weak and his efforts to do that in the cut throat cultivation world. I highly recommend CD to all readers, and especially new readers, as it is a great novel to get into reading Xianxia. I would say it is definitely worth spending time reading it and it is several times better than the average Xianxia novels.When trying to be objective I would probably rate it a 7 or 7.5/10 but the nostalgia and how much I love the elements of this novel would probably boost it to a 8.5 or 9/10 for me.

reviews Coiling Dragon.txt,"Like many others, this is the novel that got me into Chinese web novels.

I genuinely believed it when the OP worked through or a difficult situation, or that they might not come out the winner in a given fight, or whatever.This is one of two novels I've actually read start to finish more than once (the other being ISSTH), and there's a reason for that.","like many others, this is the novel that got me into chinese web novels. it is really hard to describe how nostalgic this is for me, and how well it stands up even after having read pretty much every other novel on this website. it is one of the most balanced in terms of the mc is op but also faces struggles but you always know theyll get through it type story that is really common in web novels. i genuinely believed it when the op worked through or a difficult situation, or that they might not come out the winner in a given fight, or whatever.this is one of two novels ive actually read start to finish more than once the other being issth, and theres a reason for that."
reviews Coiling Dragon.txt,"I just finished this a little while ago and I enjoyed it. I've got the memory of a whiteboard so I'll try my best to be brief.Main character is good, his relationships are nice to see and some of the moments in the story really hit hard.Power levels are nice and expanded. It feels nice to actually have an MC that can't directly fight above his level for BS reasons, it's all focused on understanding, which I prefer.Ending felt a bit rushed, basically the last book (I read it on kindle unlimited) felt like it pushed too much content into 1 book. I kinda wish the book was longer just to make the transformations a little more steady but it's not a big deal personally, and the ending itself was good.The world is fine, there was a lot of potential for more settings but the author chose to stick with a few extremely large settings which is fine.I don't feel too strongly about this one as I just read this recently and it wasn't my gateway to the genre, but I think it's good overall. I will say, though, that I still prefer desolate era to this novel, it felt more adventurous and had a stupidly grand scale but I like that.

reviews Coiling Dragon.txt,"Are you looking for a solid book? Then read CD.I really have to give it to IET for compiling such a great novel. There are some imperfections here and there but that's typical in these novels.

reviews Coiling Dragon.txt,"This is a good entry novel for western readers unfamiliar with wuxia and xianxia, because this story is mostly western fantasy, with a small portion of wuxia and xianxia.The story is fairly well written, and there are many enjoyable arcs, plot twists, and elaborate schemes. There are very few annoying tropes. There are some amazingly early foreshadowings that don't make sense until hundreds of chapters later. Some parts of the story were bland or stretched out, but they didn't last for too long. There's also a significant amount of repetition, but it wasn't too bad.The universe was fairly interesting, with many memorable locations, but there was also a lot of boring, wasted space. The power system was mostly standard elemental magic, but it had some unusual additions that totally changed things.The characters are all fairly respectable, even the forgettable side characters. Almost no one acted in a way they shouldn't have (very few brainless young masters here) and their actions were very understandable. The immortals and long-lived characters actually had a reasonable level of intelligence and maturity and didn't act like children.The main character went through several stages of development, most of which were very compelling. The emotional changes were especially striking. I really appreciate that he stuck to his morals and didn't let his power go to his head like a typical wuxia protagonist. Unfortunately, his overconfidence prevented him from learning from many of his mistakes.There are also a lot of great moments from the other characters that really made them stand out (even some good romance). That became rare in the later parts of the story, even amongst the main cast. After each arc, most characters, including many important characters, are given no further development, even the ones that occasionally appear again.There are several things that I wish the author expanded on and continued writing about (descendants, countries, stone sculpting, etc). I would welcome another hundred chapters of that.The prose itself is mostly plain, but there are times when it becomes more vivid. In particular, there are some fantastic action scenes, cultivation scenes, and emotional scenes. I really wish more of the novel was written like that.Overall, this was an enjoyable read that I might even reread at some point, and I definitely recommend it. 7.5/10.","this is a good entry novel for western readers unfamiliar with wuxia and xianxia, because this story is mostly western fantasy, with a small portion of wuxia and xianxia.the story is fairly well written, and there are many enjoyable arcs, plot twists, and elaborate schemes. there are very few annoying tropes. there are some amazingly early foreshadowings that dont make sense until hundreds of chapters later. some parts of the story were bland or stretched out, but they didnt last for too long. theres also a significant amount of repetition, but it wasnt too bad.the universe was fairly interesting, with many memorable locations, but there was also a lot of boring, wasted space. the power system was mostly standard elemental magic, but it had some unusual additions that totally changed things.the characters are all fairly respectable, even the forgettable side characters. almost no one acted in a way they shouldnt have very few brainless young masters here and their actions were very understandable. the immortals and longlived characters actually had a reasonable level of intelligence and maturity and didnt act like children.the main character went through several stages of development, most of which were very compelling. the emotional changes were especially striking. i really appreciate that he stuck to his morals and didnt let his power go to his head like a typical wuxia protagonist. unfortunately, his overconfidence prevented him from learning from many of his mistakes.there are also a lot of great moments from the other characters that really made them stand out even some good romance. that became rare in the later parts of the story, even amongst the main cast. after each arc, most characters, including many important characters, are given no further development, even the ones that occasionally appear again.there are several things that i wish the author expanded on and continued writing about descendants, countries, stone sculpting, etc. i would welcome another hundred chapters of that.the prose itself is mostly plain, but there are times when it becomes more vivid. in particular, there are some fantastic action scenes, cultivation scenes, and emotional scenes. i really wish more of the novel was written like that.overall, this was an enjoyable read that i might even reread at some point, and i definitely recommend it. 7.510."

reviews Coiling Dragon.txt,"Destroyer of Fire and Ice was a very anime vibes novel and even still it didn't give me the impression of... dull, and feeling dazed at the beginning and yet, this one not only did just that; it also gave me the feeling of wasting my time, i... i don't think there is a positive way to explain this; is like every single thing is a burden in my eyes and makes me narrow mine any time i'm reading it.I usually read - check mobile game on pc and keep reading about 3-6 minutes (when i'm getting bored at a novel without skimming).

And this one is a mix between the ones are not for me and the ones i can't understand how is it so one-sided to its readers.To not go on more and more (which i would prefer, but i don't believe at all this is worthy of it); i felt weirded out, cringe, expectations being pushed back into my chest as if i was wronging the novel for it, and what else feelings like 'there is something which definitely isn't right' while narrowing my eyes and wrinkling my nose.Couldn't bear to continue it.","destroyer of fire and ice was a very anime vibes novel and even still it didnt give me the impression of... dull, and feeling dazed at the beginning and yet, this one not only did just that it also gave me the feeling of wasting my time, i... i dont think there is a positive way to explain this is like every single thing is a burden in my eyes and makes me narrow mine any time im reading it.i usually read  check mobile game on pc and keep reading about 36 minutes when im getting bored at a novel without skimming. and when im not that interested in a novel, and wanna give it a try i go open some gaming streaming or gameplay, hell even look for other stuff on novelupdates. but this one i was very interested, so many high upvotes reviews, and even if its wuxiaworld, where or you are on one side of the fanbase in the novel or you read in another language experience  so im still gonna give it what i believe it deserves.there is nothing wrong with the writing, its there, how it should be alright. but is the style of it what makes me... actually cringe is a strange one and a new one for me, is really really unexpected. i read wmw before this, dropped around twice or thrice before finally leaving that sounds of falling down the stairszzzzzzzzzzzzzzz and knew that plagiarist did a huge one in this okay, but i can assure that, i, by no means feel like this is thanks to that the novels i enjoy so much and am glad i got the time to start reading started with me giving the same spot as the very first one i read tales of demons and gods, and as i did i could find what i wanted to keep reading and what i not but it didnt took much time for me to find another taste and that was novels that i just felt completely wrong about and disappointed. and this one is a mix between the ones are not for me and the ones i cant understand how is it so onesided to its readers.to not go on more and more which i would prefer, but i dont believe at all this is worthy of it i felt weirded out, cringe, expectations being pushed back into my chest as if i was wronging the novel for it, and what else feelings like there is something which definitely isnt right while narrowing my eyes and wrinkling my nose.couldnt bear to continue it."
reviews Coiling Dragon.txt,"I've been reading cultivation novels for about two years now. I believe this should be the number 1 novel recommended to new readers from the west after they binge the cradle series by will wight. It is by far the easiest Chinese novel to get in to. I have a hard time remembering Chinese names and it gets confusing to remember who xu fin is when there is also a xu finl, xu finral, and a xuie fang (made these names up to make a point). This novel doesn't have a bunch of subtle daoist/confucius/buddah and other Chinese mythos that are hard to understand without reading up on them for a bit.The characters are written well enough, the world building is great, and it maintains quality from start to finish. Once you get more familiar with Chinese mythos, then you can enjoy other books as well.

I would get so involved with the characters I would throw my phone across the room while reading and crying with all the heartaches. Such a beautifully well told story, I kind of feel like the ending got rushed. Development just grew by leap and bounds with every chapter which kept things exciting but left a little out for side character development.

Then, Linley starts on his road of cultivation -- which is the actual fun part.To be honest, these kind of novels that don't contain those face-slapping characters are really rare, and the writing style is also very unique.

His early growth, expanding is power and  influence and confrontation with the first major antagonist was a good read. Later on, side characters start to become more and more irrelevant, but the world building and overarching plot stays good.Romance is a bit meh but that's pretty much to be expected, if anyone knows about a novel with good romance please let me know, I'd like to see this mythical creature with my own eyes.It has a bit of a western fantasy setting, so there's no need for background knowledge on taoism or buddhism.","its been many years now since i read it, but from what i remember i enjoyed it, especially before he ascends to another world. his early growth, expanding is power and  influence and confrontation with the first major antagonist was a good read. later on, side characters start to become more and more irrelevant, but the world building and overarching plot stays good.romance is a bit meh but thats pretty much to be expected, if anyone knows about a novel with good romance please let me know, id like to see this mythical creature with my own eyes.it has a bit of a western fantasy setting, so theres no need for background knowledge on taoism or buddhism."
reviews Coiling Dragon.txt,"Very enjoyable read!This was the first Chinese novel which I actually completed (I had read around 1000 chapters of The King's Avatar before this), and it was a really great experience. I really loved the power-system in this one, elemental stuff is always a treat to read. I think that Linley is a pretty basic protagonist, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's bad, I think his interactions with his friends and family are very charming. I think the general consensus is that the story is stronger in the first half (and I'm inclined to agree) but honestly the second half wasn't bad at all in my opinion, even if it had some slow parts to it. I would definitely recommend this for a read if you haven't read many webnovels before, though maybe if you've already read a lot then you may want to find something a little more suited for your tastes.","very enjoyable read!this was the first chinese novel which i actually completed i had read around 1000 chapters of the kings avatar before this, and it was a really great experience. i really loved the powersystem in this one, elemental stuff is always a treat to read. i think that linley is a pretty basic protagonist, but that doesnt necessarily mean hes bad, i think his interactions with his friends and family are very charming. i think the general consensus is that the story is stronger in the first half and im inclined to agree but honestly the second half wasnt bad at all in my opinion, even if it had some slow parts to it. i would definitely recommend this for a read if you havent read many webnovels before, though maybe if youve already read a lot then you may want to find something a little more suited for your tastes."

reviews Coiling Dragon.txt,"It does a great job at combining western and Chinese elements into the story. The story has good pacing and progression, and the overall plot works pretty well.It does drag a little in the later parts, and the ending does seem a little rushed, but I don't think that any parts gets boring enough to drop the novel, and the ending doesn't ruin the reading experience for you. One disappointing aspect is the romance, but that is a general weakness that I've seen for the author.It's a relatively linear story-line as we keep with the MC 90% of the time. I find a good comparison might be to Naruto, as both are great introductions to the media and for better or worse strongly cater towards the teenage male audience. It's a classic in the translated scene and I think is a must read to at least help find what aspects of CN appeal to you.","it does a great job at combining western and chinese elements into the story. the story has good pacing and progression, and the overall plot works pretty well.it does drag a little in the later parts, and the ending does seem a little rushed, but i dont think that any parts gets boring enough to drop the novel, and the ending doesnt ruin the reading experience for you. one disappointing aspect is the romance, but that is a general weakness that ive seen for the author.its a relatively linear storyline as we keep with the mc 90 of the time. i find a good comparison might be to naruto, as both are great introductions to the media and for better or worse strongly cater towards the teenage male audience. its a classic in the translated scene and i think is a must read to at least help find what aspects of cn appeal to you."

This novel should be read not only with the perspective of being a novel, but with one that we goes through our life. As I am from a developing country, I can see this as the life of someone that is from a small town in search for the meaning of their life and being financial independent with their enterprise.","one of my first novels on ww and it was good.interesting world, plot and characters. i do remember not liking the cultivation methods much towards the end of the novel, at max level, where it was almost scissors paper stone match between characters. however, that is part of the unique aspects of the novel.all in all, there is some really good adventure scenes and epic fights. it has its shortcomings similar to lots of novels where side character development is negligible in progression. i wont put it as overwhelmingly recommended because that is just setting you up for disappointment, it is somewhere inbetween good and great read."

I must say it starts off full of deus ex machina but they almost disappear after the first set-back of the main protagonist. I still live in a state of denial years after I read the ending, it was truly not an ending I was looking forward to. It's easy to suggest this one but I am actually conflicted due to how traumatic the ending can be to certain people. It's a good read but you need some nihilism or absurdism to not be haunted by the end of this story. I upvoted because I had so many good memories with this story and the ending at least felt rushed and out of place so it shouldn't spoil the whole process, which was lovely.","great series! to me this is the peak of traditional written wuxia.the story is great, a young boy belonging to a now decrepit clan finds a ring and with it, sets out on a journey through dimensions filled with happiness, sorrow, love, loss and an unending desire to right the wrongs he and his family have experienced. its a story that once it steps on the gas, it wont let up. be ready to brace yourself for a hell of a ride!if you enjoyed it, read desolate era and issth! while not as classical, dragon heart also scratches a similar itch."

reviews Genius Detective.txt,"Genius Detective is basically a wonderful thriller. I would not regret having bought this as a proper book, at least so far. It is most certainly a very unusual novel, at least from what I usually read both here and offline.The Author has so far shown to me that he, unlike many other chinese authors, does play with prejudices as well BUT while the mysoginistic views of many a chinese novel that I have read so far are also shown here, they are shown by the villains if anyone. We have an over protective brother, but that is completely normal no matter where we go. No MC groping women or even considering this as far as I know. The MC is a bit over the top with his righteousness in my opinion, but that is most certainly negligible in such a setting.I personally would suggest reading this novel on your phone when youre taking the tram to get to work or school early in the morning, as it will most certainly leave your mind wondering what will happen next and you yourself will be sitting there weighing the likelihoods of who commited the crime in your head all day long. That is if you enjoy this as much as me.Now, less personal stuff and more to the structure.I like the way this novel is built very much. Both chapter length as well as volume length are very nice, we do not have long drags between volumes where you end up wondering if you should skip 3 chapters. So far the Translation has 100% obtained my acknowledgement for making an astounding job at both the general sentence structure as well as conveying chinese idioms and culture.

I have watched many crime, mystery thrillers of Jap, K-drama and English origin and this novel definitely follows a varied palette of characters similarly as there are in the best of the shows of each region.Female detective here is not dense, hut a rather willing learner which is very promising.All of them have some back-story and did not feel conjured from air.STORY(9.5/10)- The arc's are well connected. The characters always progress and learn something new.The story seamlessly transition between different point of view.Also, they do not fit the MC right into the middle of the police force but the MC uses his won witty ways and sometimes guides his friends and other acquaintances into solving the cases.WORLD-BUILDING(8.5/10)- The novel is set in a modern setting so you can expect to see China, it's custom, practice,  and it's cuisines( food stalls , a fav. of mine in these novels, :) ). The slangs, idioms and the terms used are all very intriguing and an explanation is always given at the end so it feels good learning something new.FOR THE FIRST DETECTIVE-MYSTERY NOVEL, IT IS BRILLIANT.","yay!!!!!!!so, i am pretty much excited about this novel as it open in a way least expected and shows the reality of life, something many novels of the same genre fail to do so.characters910 the dialogue and conversation, thinking process and variety of characters is topnotch. i have watched many crime, mystery thrillers of jap, kdrama and english origin and this novel definitely follows a varied palette of characters similarly as there are in the best of the shows of each region.female detective here is not dense, hut a rather willing learner which is very promising.all of them have some backstory and did not feel conjured from air.story9.510 the arcs are well connected. the characters always progress and learn something new.the story seamlessly transition between different point of view.also, they do not fit the mc right into the middle of the police force but the mc uses his won witty ways and sometimes guides his friends and other acquaintances into solving the cases.worldbuilding8.510 the novel is set in a modern setting so you can expect to see china, its custom, practice,  and its cuisines food stalls , a fav. of mine in these novels,  . the slangs, idioms and the terms used are all very intriguing and an explanation is always given at the end so it feels good learning something new.for the first detectivemystery novel, it is brilliant."

He is hiding his identity because of his mysterious past and involvement with his mortal enemy. Here's my impression of him so far: seems to be quite the funny dude, values justice, willing to teach others but does it in a tsundere way (in my opinion), scared to get close to others (in case of endangering them), cheap (kindof - knows when to give and receive), can't hold back his desire to investigate, usually acts casual with others.

Inspite of the unheard dangers lying ahead they have to maintain the protocol which is not fair to some extent even though it's law .It all shows the terror of human heart but it is not very scary to read though .

reviews Genius Detective.txt,"There are bit for me that it could improve, but not at the same time. It could be a little more realistic but then you think can it really. Cause if it was to realistic it would ruin the flow of the story. So the really only nitpick I could say about the story is that I wish it expressed more of the MCs emotions, cause at the moment it is thrilling but is missing a little substance for my taste. However, I have a gourmet taste, so it is not like I eat gourmet meals all the time. This novel so far is set out very well, if it continues at steady pace and goes in the general direction that i hope with no major detours it should be a nice relaxing read in the sense that I donât need to have a heart attack saying no one donât do that stupid thing you know wont lead to anything good.(Like ohh there is a sound lets investigate, like in a horror movie) So with that said I would highly recommend reading it, might be no fantasy novel but it is has a lot of stuff that a fantasy can sometimes forget. Ps hopes MC gets a happy ending wink wink nudge nudge.Edit to Chapter 89: Still feel the same way but it is doing a little better with character progression then i thought. So it gets a higher recommendation from me.78% recommendation before about 83% now could Improve in the future.This recommendation score is based on my predictions of the sub-plots and the main-plot.

reviews Genius Detective.txt,"I have read three volumes so far and at first I thought, the novel was bad but then I realised I was the ignorant one. At first I thought it was spoon-feeding the audience to much. I took a step back to realise the novel does a good job of 'teaching' the audience as well as guiding you in the right direction and getting you to think for yourself. I believe the audience is in a similar position and can relate to Lin Dongxue's characters as she learns to think of various reasons under the clues and hints provided by the MC.Obviously the novel comes with red herrings as do most detective novels, however the ones in this novel seem very lacklustre as you know the MC is definitely moving in the right direction at all times. I think a simple way to summarise this is the idea of waiting for the conclusion of everything rather than enjoying the process, as the MC so far has never been in the wrong. This leads to little engagement with the novel itself and I therefore put my attention elsewhere in the story this led to me becoming more invested in the relationships between the characters and how they have slowly developed, I think this is one of the strong points of the novel.","i have read three volumes so far and at first i thought, the novel was bad but then i realised i was the ignorant one. at first i thought it was spoonfeeding the audience to much. i took a step back to realise the novel does a good job of teaching the audience as well as guiding you in the right direction and getting you to think for yourself. i believe the audience is in a similar position and can relate to lin dongxues characters as she learns to think of various reasons under the clues and hints provided by the mc.obviously the novel comes with red herrings as do most detective novels, however the ones in this novel seem very lacklustre as you know the mc is definitely moving in the right direction at all times. i think a simple way to summarise this is the idea of waiting for the conclusion of everything rather than enjoying the process, as the mc so far has never been in the wrong. this leads to little engagement with the novel itself and i therefore put my attention elsewhere in the story this led to me becoming more invested in the relationships between the characters and how they have slowly developed, i think this is one of the strong points of the novel."

reviews Genius Detective.txt,"Okay, so basically I am the type of guy who does not like Detective Conan, why? Brcause its one of those anime that I remember was being spoken about when I was a child, so I compare it to childish cartoon, I know this is 100% wrong, and I know it is not childish, however, not gonna be bothered to waste a lot of time on an anime when I can read novels xD.However, what made start this novel is the lack of good novels (not updated I mean) nowadays.After I started, I literally flashed through the chapters like sonic through rings.What made me like this novel is not just the amazing way of thinking, how it makes your mind work so hard in these boring days, how you need to think out of the box, but the god damn character.

reviews Genius Detective.txt,"At first I really enjoyed the novel, even though the beginning with the MC as a ""police consulting Uber driver"" is a bit far fetched.After the the first few volumes we even see character growth and improvement of detective skills of side characters.And although there some minor inaccuracies when compared to how various things work in real life, it was negligible.But in ""Volume 21 â Master Hypnotist"" the author treats hypnosis as if it was something akin to mind control magic (you can skim through wikipedia to get an idea how it really works).

reviews Genius Detective.txt,"Currently have kind of mixed feelings about this novel. So far, I've read up to chapter 60 and really love the plot, but am not a fan of either of the two main characters. Each mystery is very well written and interesting to read, however, the characters are rather bland. I've found myself skipping past paragraphs of character interaction to get back to reading the actual plot.I had rather high hopes for the MC after reading other comments that praised the fact that he wasn't the typical arrogant misogynistic male love interest. Unfortunately, it turns out that the MC is this perverted old man who is more annoying to read about than some overbearing CEO. His flirting and forwardness seems to be some sort of running joke that's supposed to be humorous, but is a bit overboard for me and makes me cringe. The FL is a typical tsundere. Add the two characters together, and you get extremely repetitive banter where the MC keeps hitting on the FL, FL gets embarrassed, and MC says that he's not romantically interested. It's rather frustrating to keep reading, because I just don't understand the purpose of making the MC so flirty, as it detracts from the plot and the rest of his character. In every other aspect, the MC is a very interesting person. As a detective with some grey morals and a backstory, he would've been a very intriguing character if he didn't act so weirdly perverted. Maybe he's got some personal reason for acting this way and I haven't gotten to the part where they explain it yet, but it's been 60 chapters and it's really making me lose interest when his flirting and dirty jokes interrupt the plot every two paragraphs.I'll be dropping this novel for now, and maybe give it another change again some day when I'm really bored.","currently have kind of mixed feelings about this novel. so far, ive read up to chapter 60 and really love the plot, but am not a fan of either of the two main characters. each mystery is very well written and interesting to read, however, the characters are rather bland. ive found myself skipping past paragraphs of character interaction to get back to reading the actual plot.i had rather high hopes for the mc after reading other comments that praised the fact that he wasnt the typical arrogant misogynistic male love interest. unfortunately, it turns out that the mc is this perverted old man who is more annoying to read about than some overbearing ceo. his flirting and forwardness seems to be some sort of running joke thats supposed to be humorous, but is a bit overboard for me and makes me cringe. the fl is a typical tsundere. add the two characters together, and you get extremely repetitive banter where the mc keeps hitting on the fl, fl gets embarrassed, and mc says that hes not romantically interested. its rather frustrating to keep reading, because i just dont understand the purpose of making the mc so flirty, as it detracts from the plot and the rest of his character. in every other aspect, the mc is a very interesting person. as a detective with some grey morals and a backstory, he wouldve been a very intriguing character if he didnt act so weirdly perverted. maybe hes got some personal reason for acting this way and i havent gotten to the part where they explain it yet, but its been 60 chapters and its really making me lose interest when his flirting and dirty jokes interrupt the plot every two paragraphs.ill be dropping this novel for now, and maybe give it another change again some day when im really bored."

reviews Genius Detective.txt,"edit: While I still think it's an interesting series, I reached chapter 538 and came to a stopping point. It's extraordinarily easy to put down this series and not pick it back up again. 538 hit a new point of Nationalism, and the arc before would have been fine.. but the author keeps forgetting that he has a kid at home. An elementary kid orphan, victim of having her family murdered in front of her, is often left home for days/weeks without anyone. Luckily she found a creepy neighbor to feed her, but the complete lack of any thought leaves only one direction as a bad plot device later on.

Essentially an adult Detective Conan.

But if you're like me and you can't stand that type of character I don't recommend.Otherwise, this is actually a really good read.

reviews Desolate Era.txt,"Honest Review : My First L(ightn)OVE(l) , the one which made me aware of vast world of Wuxia...For new readers I would like to recommend this as must and that's why I will make this review as simple and interesting as possible :Why you should read it :----------------------------1. Its good for newbies(well.. its of course importatant if you are new and exploring this world of wuxia, so unless you are addicted like me you might not have even considered exploring this branch of literature)2. It has vast world and with continuous progression of Main Character. ( if you have seen DBZ, then you know what I mean. )  MC gets started on cultivation path and he builts himself on his own. Of course he inherits few things along the way but, he is creator of his knowledge and power.3. The plot feels genuine and when I say genuine, MC is simple guy striving to be the best. There are no/few snobby/bossy characters who give the lip service and then loose after MC gets sudden power boost (which happens a lot in other novels). No harem / stupid women who falls in love like crazy. Of course I am not against harem but having them around kind of adds show-offish side to MC which I personally dislike.4. While I am on topic of harem and personal relationship, the author also roamed in that area and he has created a sweet love story between MC and his wife (also another imp character in story) which forces you to sympathize with MC and cheer him from the bottom of your heart. Having lack of other women kind of emphasises this taking you even closer to MC and his life and struggle.5. Find new goal -&gt; Sword Fight -&gt; Struggle to be the best -&gt; repeatAlthough these four words sum up everything, the cultivation branches which Author have added along side gives you solid impression of how vast the world is and even you start feeling how minuscule MC is and why it is importatant for him to achieve even more greatness. The storyline add upto this feeling.6. World is vast .. yeah .. to be exact tooooo vast. But while author made this world huge he has not failed to give justice to entire universe and it actually feels whole not like other novels where MC when goes above and beyond, the place where he rose from are forgotten and non-importatant. I am unable to explain this but well... you will know what I am talking about if you read this.7. Now, let's talk about Cultivation levels. They are also easier to understand and properly defined unlike certain novels where they go on and on continuously and you feel like there is no end whatever that is going on. This one aspect helps you stay engrossed as the plot continues and doesn't bore you.8. Villans -&gt; Now these are one important part of the story. Author has successfully established a plot where you, yourself starts getting the feeling of ""He's coming.... He's coming... He's coming .... "". With perfect insertion of fight of minions leading towards the fight with main villan... I guarentee that its surely going to keep you on your toes.9. All is well that ends well...The end is good or rather Happy Ending with MC achieving everything that he desires. Although, I would have liked the story to go on, I am content with what I have receieved.This gives you a wholesome feeling, a happiness which births from within your heart.10. All in all , this novel has many things which you will find missing in others. And I am quite sure this is one novel which you will enjoy even if you read many times.Why you shouldnt read it :----------------------------1. Meh !! ... You dont want to read this huge novel.Thats the only point i can add here. Afterall, you are your own boss.On an endnote, I would like to thank Author : ""I Eat Tomatoes"" and Translator : ""RWX"" for allowing me an opportunity to read this amazing piece of art.

I just love how it takes so many elements we are familiar with and gives'em a twist, if you are of those like me that feel most MC just take inheritances without leaving one behind the you gotta read this, if you are of those that are looking for a novel where cultivating more and getting enlighted really matters then you gotta read this.In summary this novel, in my humblest opinion has what other similar lacks, and to prove that preferences are subjective the novel i prefer over this one lacks some of the things that i value of this one.","as always i want to be sincere and this is not my favorite novel but it definetly enters the top 3 and it even is the 2nd novel i have read more times. i just love how it takes so many elements we are familiar with and givesem a twist, if you are of those like me that feel most mc just take inheritances without leaving one behind the you gotta read this, if you are of those that are looking for a novel where cultivating more and getting enlighted really matters then you gotta read this.in summary this novel, in my humblest opinion has what other similar lacks, and to prove that preferences are subjective the novel i prefer over this one lacks some of the things that i value of this one."
reviews Desolate Era.txt,"DE takes on many similarities from Talisman Emperor (TE) which is an ongoing translation at the time of this review. However, even though TE was written first, DE took ideas from TE and made them 100x more fleshed out and better. Similar concepts include ki refiners vs. fiendgod body refiners, sword insight, heart energy, minor daos vs. grand daos, inheriting an unfathomable manor at the start, the similarities goes on. If you enjoyed the premise of TEâs cultivation system but regretted that the author there took too many detours, then DE is perfect for you. Main example is the uniqueness of the different daos. Not everything is just swish slash pretty lights make things go boom. Water is defensive, wind is fast, etc. Also the MC learns techniques that have clearly distinct functions from each other. Itâs not just a dozen different ways to sever heads.Also DE does a great job with the idea of cultivators taking great risks for fortune and cultivators experiencing setbacks to temper themselves. In other words, the MCâs plot armor is just the right level of thickness to make his actions and decisions believable. The MC is a genius, but not to the point where everything comes easy for him - ie breakthroughs donât always happens right when the plot conveniently needs it. One such breakthrough happens after the MC experienced real loss that impacts the audience/readers. I wonât say anymore to spoil that.Overall easily in my top 2 novels to recommend.","de takes on many similarities from talisman emperor te which is an ongoing translation at the time of this review. however, even though te was written first, de took ideas from te and made them 100x more fleshed out and better. similar concepts include ki refiners vs. fiendgod body refiners, sword insight, heart energy, minor daos vs. grand daos, inheriting an unfathomable manor at the start, the similarities goes on. if you enjoyed the premise of tes cultivation system but regretted that the author there took too many detours, then de is perfect for you. main example is the uniqueness of the different daos. not everything is just swish slash pretty lights make things go boom. water is defensive, wind is fast, etc. also the mc learns techniques that have clearly distinct functions from each other. its not just a dozen different ways to sever heads.also de does a great job with the idea of cultivators taking great risks for fortune and cultivators experiencing setbacks to temper themselves. in other words, the mcs plot armor is just the right level of thickness to make his actions and decisions believable. the mc is a genius, but not to the point where everything comes easy for him  ie breakthroughs dont always happens right when the plot conveniently needs it. one such breakthrough happens after the mc experienced real loss that impacts the audiencereaders. i wont say anymore to spoil that.overall easily in my top 2 novels to recommend."

reviews Desolate Era.txt,"One of the best novels one the site and the one that brought me into the world of Chinese cultivation novels. Despite a slightly generic start of being reborn in another world, It differs a lot from the various stories with invincible protagonists. What we get is a beautiful well written world with interesting cultivation system, which heavily rely on the understanding of ""Dao"", unlike other novels, where you can become world strongest person by consuming an insane amount of magic pills and a great plot, which hold you captivated during the reading and force you to stay all night just so you could see what happens next. I especially liked the later half of the story, where we get several especially unique story arcs, which are extremely hard to find anywhere else, such as the arc, where the protagonist travels along with an equally strong friend during a dangerous journey to various parts of the unknown world. We see them traveling together, helping each other and forming a strong bond, which will last a lifetime.  Highly recommended to both new and old readers.","one of the best novels one the site and the one that brought me into the world of chinese cultivation novels. despite a slightly generic start of being reborn in another world, it differs a lot from the various stories with invincible protagonists. what we get is a beautiful well written world with interesting cultivation system, which heavily rely on the understanding of dao, unlike other novels, where you can become world strongest person by consuming an insane amount of magic pills and a great plot, which hold you captivated during the reading and force you to stay all night just so you could see what happens next. i especially liked the later half of the story, where we get several especially unique story arcs, which are extremely hard to find anywhere else, such as the arc, where the protagonist travels along with an equally strong friend during a dangerous journey to various parts of the unknown world. we see them traveling together, helping each other and forming a strong bond, which will last a lifetime.  highly recommended to both new and old readers."
reviews Desolate Era.txt,"One of the novels that hooked me up !This main character is a very humane man to a fault, a model behaviour quite rare in this kind of novel : fidelity, trustworthiness, kindness,  even empathy... but the poor man has a very sad personal life and most of his motivation for pushing ever forward is either preventing the destruction of all he cherishes, or trying to repair some previous damages. This makes for a very touching story that evolves rather naturally from beginning to end pushed by feelings rather than ambition.Yet it is packed full with action, combat, ambushes, and the feeling of thirst for more stays with you all along.Most likely my favourite wuxia novel for it is unlike most. It avoids most of the cliched tropes and offers a novel approach.","one of the novels that hooked me up !this main character is a very humane man to a fault, a model behaviour quite rare in this kind of novel  fidelity, trustworthiness, kindness,  even empathy... but the poor man has a very sad personal life and most of his motivation for pushing ever forward is either preventing the destruction of all he cherishes, or trying to repair some previous damages. this makes for a very touching story that evolves rather naturally from beginning to end pushed by feelings rather than ambition.yet it is packed full with action, combat, ambushes, and the feeling of thirst for more stays with you all along.most likely my favourite wuxia novel for it is unlike most. it avoids most of the cliched tropes and offers a novel approach."
reviews Desolate Era.txt,i would not normally review this because it wasnt bad but i feel like i have to dislike from the enormous amount of people who havent read more than ten novels here. the best way to describe it would be it does what its asked for but what its asked to do isnt much. its pretty much like nine star hegemon demon but in a different setting. the mc gets gifted everything on a silver platter the reviews say he worked for everything but as soon as you arrive he gets two of the best techniques out there one of them is going to get even stronger as it isnt complete and the only reason this started was because apparently he is the only person who ever donated to kids on earth,i would not normally review this because it wasnt bad but i feel like i have to dislike from the enormous amount of people who havent read more than ten novels here. the best way to describe it would be it does what its asked for but what its asked to do isnt much. its pretty much like nine star hegemon demon but in a different setting. the mc gets gifted everything on a silver platter the reviews say he worked for everything but as soon as you arrive he gets two of the best techniques out there one of them is going to get even stronger as it isnt complete and the only reason this started was because apparently he is the only person who ever donated to kids on earth
reviews Desolate Era.txt,"I loved this story this author is like my favorite Chinese author. I have this as my second favorite story and it is the second story I finished reading. Coiling Dragon is the first one that I finished and also in the first place.Let's see where should I start, I think this story did a really great job on the reincarnation trope. This is saying something since it is a very common trope and most are just annoying in the beginning since they are almost copied and pasted from other similar stories.The main character is amazing honestly, I love how he progressed through his cultivation without using some cheat ability. I always loved reading about how things in nature-inspired him to create certain sword skills.The romance was done really well, it pulled at your heart. The relationships, in general, were pretty great.Just like in the coiling dragon, not all the side characters were really important throughout the story. But I Eat Tomatoes does a good job of bringing certain ones back throughout the story when necessary to show they are not forgotten.The cultivation is different than in coiling dragon and is also very easy to understand. Certain cultivating stories honestly lose me throughout the story. I tend to have to keep like a notepad just to remember what the realms are and so on. But this story is not one of them.I could go on and on but I will end it here, if you are interested you should just go read it yourself I promise you will not regret reading it.

reviews Desolate Era.txt,"This is my first review of a novel on this site, even though I've read a bunch of very good ones. DE was one of the few novels that kept me hooked all the way through. Many cultivation-type novels, even the very good ones, have long, drawn-out, multi-chapter battles, annoying cockaroach villains who last for a hundred plus chapters, super-power ups, and repetative plots that reoccur every time the MC reaches a new location.This one not so much. The plot continued to move forward at a brisk pace, and once the MC encounters the bad guys, they normally don't last longer than a few dozen chapters, sometimes not even a single fight. When the MC does gain a 'new level of understanding' or breaks through to another level it's through hard work and not because of some super-treasure within him. The MC is likable, not at all arrogant or power-hungry, and I genuinely was interested in seeing what was in store for him after every chapter.The few things I would critique about the novel is that there is little romance even though the MC's driving motivation is based on his feelings for a certain character. It is not a harem story, but it's barely a romance one too. Also, with the exception of a few supporting characters (who were still pretty shallow character-wise), many of the side-characters have similar personalities and weren't all that intersting to me. The fact that the MC also makes new friends and leaves behind old ones every ten or so books  made it hard for me to grow attached to these new 'more powerful' versions of his previous traveling companions.But the story did leave me with a happy feeling in the end and I stayed up way too late too many nights in a row reading this story. This was a fun, uncomplicated read that was worth one of my VIP-completed-works-a-month slots. I have to thank the entire team who worked on this for their hard work and the author for coming up with this in the first place!","this is my first review of a novel on this site, even though ive read a bunch of very good ones. de was one of the few novels that kept me hooked all the way through. many cultivationtype novels, even the very good ones, have long, drawnout, multichapter battles, annoying cockaroach villains who last for a hundred plus chapters, superpower ups, and repetative plots that reoccur every time the mc reaches a new location.this one not so much. the plot continued to move forward at a brisk pace, and once the mc encounters the bad guys, they normally dont last longer than a few dozen chapters, sometimes not even a single fight. when the mc does gain a new level of understanding or breaks through to another level its through hard work and not because of some supertreasure within him. the mc is likable, not at all arrogant or powerhungry, and i genuinely was interested in seeing what was in store for him after every chapter.the few things i would critique about the novel is that there is little romance even though the mcs driving motivation is based on his feelings for a certain character. it is not a harem story, but its barely a romance one too. also, with the exception of a few supporting characters who were still pretty shallow characterwise, many of the sidecharacters have similar personalities and werent all that intersting to me. the fact that the mc also makes new friends and leaves behind old ones every ten or so books  made it hard for me to grow attached to these new more powerful versions of his previous traveling companions.but the story did leave me with a happy feeling in the end and i stayed up way too late too many nights in a row reading this story. this was a fun, uncomplicated read that was worth one of my vipcompletedworksamonth slots. i have to thank the entire team who worked on this for their hard work and the author for coming up with this in the first place!"
reviews Desolate Era.txt,"The story is great until around book 39. I just completely lost all interest after one of the turns the author decided to take. It just completely killed any kind of excitement I had for the story and even though it continued I just couldn't bring myself to continue reading.For the first 39 books the story is actually great and a masterwork on conflict and storytelling. The only criticism I have for it is the relationships are kinda forced, but everything else is always fresh, exciting, and doesn't repeat plotlines like a lot of novels of the same genre.","the story is great until around book 39. i just completely lost all interest after one of the turns the author decided to take. it just completely killed any kind of excitement i had for the story and even though it continued i just couldnt bring myself to continue reading.for the first 39 books the story is actually great and a masterwork on conflict and storytelling. the only criticism i have for it is the relationships are kinda forced, but everything else is always fresh, exciting, and doesnt repeat plotlines like a lot of novels of the same genre."
reviews Desolate Era.txt,"My favorite thing about this novel has to be the power scaling and cultivation system. In a lot of novels, the idea of immortality is the central focus of the entire cultivation system, and as such only the most supreme and all powerful cultivator ever gains immortality. In line with this the cultivation systems in those novels are usually very simple, you gather qi(or whatever that novel calls it) until you level up and you pass through a fixed number of levels before breaking through to the next realm. However DE throws all this on it's head. It's completely possible to essentially live almost infinitely long before you reach the end of the cultivation system, and by the time you're 2 levels from the last realm, you're already truly biologically immortal, and this is reflected in the motivation of different characters.Furthermore the cultivation system is different from the standard gather qi and level up. Each realm is clearly different from the one before, and the requirements to reach the next realm are well explained and laid out. And pretty early on the concept of laws becomes really important. Talent alone doesn't cut it in DE. Even if you could suck in an entire universe of qi it wouldn't make any difference, that has nothing to do with ascending the ladder of cultivation. Subsequently everyone's journey through the cultivation system is different, because they must follow their own path. That uniqueness about the cultivation system is probably what makes it my favorite in all Xiania.","my favorite thing about this novel has to be the power scaling and cultivation system. in a lot of novels, the idea of immortality is the central focus of the entire cultivation system, and as such only the most supreme and all powerful cultivator ever gains immortality. in line with this the cultivation systems in those novels are usually very simple, you gather qior whatever that novel calls it until you level up and you pass through a fixed number of levels before breaking through to the next realm. however de throws all this on its head. its completely possible to essentially live almost infinitely long before you reach the end of the cultivation system, and by the time youre 2 levels from the last realm, youre already truly biologically immortal, and this is reflected in the motivation of different characters.furthermore the cultivation system is different from the standard gather qi and level up. each realm is clearly different from the one before, and the requirements to reach the next realm are well explained and laid out. and pretty early on the concept of laws becomes really important. talent alone doesnt cut it in de. even if you could suck in an entire universe of qi it wouldnt make any difference, that has nothing to do with ascending the ladder of cultivation. subsequently everyones journey through the cultivation system is different, because they must follow their own path. that uniqueness about the cultivation system is probably what makes it my favorite in all xiania."
reviews Desolate Era.txt,"A good story with a reasonable story progression.  The MC progresses well and has some lucky encounters, but still has to apply himself to succeed.  The story is engaging and entertaining, and the relationships are reasonable.  Even getting a massive windfall still meant that he didn't actually get the whole windfall.  It helped him develop but didn't move him to be magically overpowered all of a sudden.At the end it tends to drag on a little bit.  I read almost the entire novel, but at the end you could see ""the writing on the wall"", as it were.  Once the outcome was completely clear I lost interest, so I didn't read the final chapters.

reviews Desolate Era.txt,"Another Brilliant work by i eat tomatoesIn DE we are witness of one of the most exaggerated usage of numbers in all of the CN novels but the author was skillful enough to use all of those to not damage your experience in the novelOne of the biggest aspects of the DE is the world development and character development to the level of near perfection which is hardly seen in other novels and it will keep you satisfied in the +2000 chapter of this novelI wont say that this novel is perfect , sometimes it gets boring but its not to the point you cant consider it a big drop in the process of reading and its near to the point that you can disregard it and author did an absolute amazing job of writing the story so you can enjoy it without getting bored all the timeOne of the things that i like about the DE the most and its hardly seen in other novels is that the author in the starting chapter brings you in the family of the MC and show you the passion between the family members and gives you a detailed explanation of the situation of the family and it makes you feel more connected to MC and its not like flashbacks in some other novels or like MC always says i have to protect my family but you almost never see his family and only saw one or two lines about it in every some hundred or so chapters which makes you think about how unfilial the MC is sometimes but i have to say i wasnt satisfied with MCs relationship with his daughter and i think author could have worked more on itThe cultivation process in this novel is one of the best and you have clear picture of the MCs cultivation and although the MC is op he is not op to the point of being crazily powerful and smash everyone in front of him and he have his fair share of loses and setbacksAll in all , DE is a story about reincarnation of a normal boy of the modern earth to cultivation world when he doesnt have divine body or a heaven defying cultivation technique which belongs to the realm of supergods or a treasure of super over cosmic divine grade or genius capable of comperhending the heavens in the three seconds while he is a fetus or a wise sage who lived for ten billion years to lead him and explain everything to him and other forms of cliche which other authors use for making their characters extraordinary ( i dont mean any disrespect towards other atuhors though ) . he is

reviews Desolate Era.txt,"Overall a good novel with decent plot, we have some interesting intense moments that can move you and the fights are enjoyable. It can feel repetitive sometimes but there's   variety when things  feel too stale so bonus points for the author for recognising those periods. A big downside in my opinion is the romance. Without making any spoilers I'm warning you, this is all either black or white. The obsessive fixation of the MC is overwhelmingly frustrating at many points in the story and IT WON'T STOP until the very end of the novel. Don't expect improvements in that regard.Do you want to read a good fighting cultivation novel? Go for it.

He has a loving family and that's how he starts to train in the sword.Throughout the story you can see how much he loves his family and loved ones and pushes himself from a regular human to gain power. There is a lot of blood, sweat, and tears in this story. It almost seems that just like his past life of helping and doing do much for others, he does the same in this life. I think that he stays true to himself even though the circumstances change. In some ways he grows a lot as a person, especially as he gains more power.

reviews Desolate Era.txt,"Read it from beginning to end, for what it is, it is good. I read this after CD (Coiled Dragon) and it was worth it and. It's not like most novels with harems or vengeance killing to move it's plots and the power systems is well thought out.Having read a lot of Chinese novels in the same veins as MGA, this is rather refreshing. It has some elements of those other novels but is doing its own thing at the same time. You have questions and their answers on what is Dao, leveling up, face-smacking, and their own struggles and growth. Though after a certain amount of volumes, it expands more into world building and the adventures of Ji Ning than of those around it or whom we have met before.","read it from beginning to end, for what it is, it is good. i read this after cd coiled dragon and it was worth it and. its not like most novels with harems or vengeance killing to move its plots and the power systems is well thought out.having read a lot of chinese novels in the same veins as mga, this is rather refreshing. it has some elements of those other novels but is doing its own thing at the same time. you have questions and their answers on what is dao, leveling up, facesmacking, and their own struggles and growth. though after a certain amount of volumes, it expands more into world building and the adventures of ji ning than of those around it or whom we have met before."

reviews Desolate Era.txt,"Desolate Era is one of my favorite novels. I actually care about a lot of the characters when I read this so when all of them start dieing like flies it really sucks. Okay, just joking, but characters DO DIE in this novel. The MC, Ji Ning, isn't always strong enough to save the people he cares about and this is his primary motivation, to protect his family, friends, teachers, etc. So don't worry, he isn't getting stronger because someone called him trash and things just escalated rapidly from there. Imagine if no one ever bullied Chu Feng or called him trash? MGA would never have had a story!Anyways, where was I? Oh yeah, doing a review. The world building mainly relies on Chinese mythology, especially the first half, so characters like Nuwa, Pangu, Son Wukong, and a lot of other characters from various Buddhist and daoist legends show up throughout.Also, the cultivation system relies HEAVILY on understanding the ""Dao"" or the mysteries of the universe which means this is, in my opinion, an excellent cultivation system where the MC is not just randomly leveling up.For the most part the world building actually carries the story for most of the novel. I am ALWAYS interested about the new places he travels, the stories behind them. What I guess I am trying to say is the world feels REAL. For example I feel the Grand Xia Dynasty is a real empire, and not some random place. It actually has laws and order, and while might always makes right in this universe, the evil vilians still have to make sure they stay in the shadows or at the very least make sure that have a good casus belli.But what makes this novel REALLY GOOD! Is that Ji Ning uses Swords. Swords are cool. They are a REAL cultivators weapon! There is a reason they call him the Sword Saint Ji Ning!

reviews Desolate Era.txt,"I, personally would not recommend this novel because of few factors.1. Story is average.2. Characters are not well built especially MC.3. Each event/process/phenomenon is hastily mentioned which is theorictally difficult to visualise.4. The story has sudden twists and turns which a reader at least expects from a novel.Aside from story , in which is about three realms fighting each other Endlessly which is typical in human history, MC character is childish and immature. He gets confused, puzzled, amused, shocked, happy, sad, raged, instantly. This is sign of childish attitude. He readily accepts offers and invitations,by which he easily gets into trouble. He invites trouble everytime he goes out adventuring. He has thousands of years to live but he is in such a hurry like his gf is gonna get raped anytime.

The pacing was really good and I quite enjoyed the focus on cultivation was not so much take this pill it gives you energy or the blood of a divine beast, giving immense power and was a lot more based off of use of the daos (elements).The plot itself is interesting, with setbacks, wars and takes a unique direction in some parts. And all the characters seem consistent to their beliefs and the way they are portrayed till the end. Great piece and I definitely recommend.","so, i have tried a fair few chinese novels that include a basis of cultivation.this is the only one that was consistently good enough to keep me gripped enough to finish the whole story. the pacing was really good and i quite enjoyed the focus on cultivation was not so much take this pill it gives you energy or the blood of a divine beast, giving immense power and was a lot more based off of use of the daos elements.the plot itself is interesting, with setbacks, wars and takes a unique direction in some parts. and all the characters seem consistent to their beliefs and the way they are portrayed till the end. great piece and i definitely recommend."

reviews Desolate Era.txt,"I've read many novels over the last few years of being a reader of the cultivation genre, and honestly, this one just hit the spot. I wish there were a few more chapters at the end so we could get a look at the future of the chaosverse or other chaosverses, but it was still a good read. It was enjoyable for the most part, there were obviously a few things which many people didn't like, myself included. But it was honestly negligible once you get to the end, as it makes you look back and say ""you know what, Ji Ning really came around"". Ning's character was fleshed out very well, the other characters were too, as you really grew attached to some of them (especially Ninedust <3333).

reviews Desolate Era.txt,"An enjoyable read. The increase of power and the cultivation progress of Ji Ning was well developed by the author. The only downside was the time scale - billions of years. To suspend belief for a cultivation fantasy is fairly easy; for the billions of years timescale - not so easy. I almost dismissed the work after reading the first few chapters, but I kept plugging at it until it captured my attention. I am glad I continued reading. The author created interesting worlds and interesting beings with some exceptions, e.g. the Aeonians.

The main cultivation technique Ji Ning uses in a large portion of the story is really a masterstroke by I Eat Tomatoes. It's recognized everywhere as the end all be all greatest cultivation technique there is, but the key is, it's also ubiquitous. Even the smallest clans in the middle of nowhere have a copy. However, it has a huge hurdle simply of comprehension. No more stupid arcs about getting an ultra powerful technique. The only way to get power in this world is by being talented and working hard.The cultivation system is fricking awesome in DE. This is because it's mostly about comprehension, not energy gathering. The audience isn't kept completely in the dark about the cultivation levels above the MC, because the world feels like it's actually connected. Why would a province have never heard of the next tier of cultivation just because they're weak?Which leads to another point. The structure of the setting is such that cultivators are few and far between. Thus, the trope of the MC starting in the weakest city in the weakest country on the weakest continent in the weakest planet, just so there's a reason he starts at the bottom is almost completely absent. Talented cultivators search far and wide for talented disciples. They know that people with fewer resources are not inherently less talented, so nowhere is cut off from the rest of society. It's not a mystery to anyone just how big the world is, at least at first. But when they get that far, you'll find the reasoning is justified. Of course, a big portion of this all is the cultivation technique Ji Ning uses. All that is required is talent, not money.Super arrogant rich brats practically have no place here, because no matter how many resources a faction has, if the young master is an idiot, he's not gonna to travel very far in the way of the Dao.However, the biggest praise I can heap on DE is that it never feels like the MC is pressured to leave an area arbitrarily just because the plot needs to move on. Unlike some (read: most) novels of a similar type, he is almost never forced onto the run with no way of fighting back, biding his time until he can strike back--for all of two chapters before his actions cause even more trouble than before.

PLEASE READ IT","okay ladies and gentleman, i am starting this masterpiece. i was searching around for new novels cause i nolifed everything possible on wuxia. i heard this novel is very great with good plot and reasonable fights and powerups. just hope mc isnt some brainless mf who goes crazy at anything. like nshba, so disappointed with the lc recent decisions. so here i am starting this, with full hopes i will not be disappointed and i shall embarked on this dao! wish me luck, ill be done in a few months if not a month. i need some words for the 100 mark, ok, i achieved it, bye."
reviews Desolate Era.txt,"I've read or started reading about 35 novels over the last couple of years on this site. Still an easy top 5 book, possibly top 3.If you enjoyed this and are looking for other novels I recommend coiling dragon, A will eternal, I shall seal the heavens, and a record of a mortals journey to immortality.Wu Dong Qian Kun, Battle through the Heavens, and Renegade immortal are honorable mentions and worth reading as well.This section is just filler because apparently we're required 100 words which is a bit crazy. Maybe some people always prefer reading concise reviews.","now i have read this book 3 times over. each time i get to understand the nuances of the story and ji nings character a little bit better than last time.the novel had a good flow with chapters and really enjoyable fight scenes! super satisfying. if you like martial arts and a bit of fantasy, this novel is amazing and the concepts are interesting.the romance aspect is something that it probably wouldve been better without but hes a man of character and passion! it makes sense! novel maintains a good balance of personal growth and romantic growth.some people might feel discouraged from the amount of chapters but it goes quick! if i had one real critique its that we have to use karma to read it chapters now but alas, still gotta support!"

reviews Desolate Era.txt,"vraiment super lecture l'hero est top Ã§a avec un MC comme d'habl'histoire nous plonge dans une immense monde avec une diversification des ennemies et monstres incroyableUn vrai chef-oeuvre a lâÃ©tat pure pour moi j'adore je suis simplement au milieu des chapitres mais je reste bÃ©a et je suis immersif dans ce monde . Le personnage principal est dotÃ© de talent de combat vraiment sympa. Par contre comme dans toutes les histoires asiatique 90%, le hÃ©ros est dotÃ© d'une capacitÃ© de base hyper badass ... ils s'entrainent tellement plus les autres ennemies que le heros est tellement puissant que je trouve des fois un peu trop abuser ca courbe de croissance en de chance aussi...",so fare great ive only read a bit but im digging it. the action is top grade. the fights unbelievable. non stop. the drama and villains are engaging. i would recommend this to anyone as their first wixia novel. the first three books are now on amazon kindle. and thats where i read them. amazing. i came here to read the rest of the series. cant wait to finish it. ive read quite a few and this one is absolutely one of the best ive read. i really enjoy it. captured my attention like few other novels have. i can only say impressive.
reviews Desolate Era.txt,"Re-reading this book and it is such a joy.  Great character development, from a weak mortal MC to his end state.  MC has lucky encounters, but also relied on his perseverance and talent to train/upgrade.If you enjoy journeying with the MC from small city to country, world and universe, then this is a novel for you.The world building is fantastic and I Eat Tomato managed to weave a lot of Chinese myths and well-known mythical characters into the story.Fight scenes, flying swords, magical and different levels of power you expect from his collections of novels.The only downside is (spoiler) the support characters do get left behind fast.  And his most important people don't get much mention considering how important 'they' are to his life.  Worth a read!","all my judgements are based on the 900 chapters i have read so far.the story is at most....avarage. his wife is tortured for many years in the 18 fucking hells but this guy doesnt give a damn about it, he just closes his eyes and feels bad for her.the guy mc advances in cultivation like hot knife through tofu while the rest of the people in the book who have lived for trillions of yearsand this isnt even considered too much, this book calculated age in chaos cycles which is equivalent to 100s of trillions of years and nearly all of them have lived for many chaos cycles. do not advance at all, like how dumb are they.another thing that pissed me off is how dumb the his resolve for cultivating is , this point is two fold ,first he had a chance to save his wifemany chances tbh now let me tell u these chances r not written in the story obviously but exists as could have been scenarios. like for gods sake his wife is being tortured and his. master plan is to keep killing until the enemy is forced to release his wife.i mean how absurd is that, it makes no sense.after his wife is dead he wants to cultivate hard and revive her , now u would ask me how? well he knows a method to do so which is pull her out of river of destiny , now who the fuck told him this method, this method of reviving was not mentioned anywhere in the cultivation world or was told to him by someone of higher cultivation, this method has no base which the writer should have given.secondly, the peoplecultivators in this series gain immortality at around 17 of the total way to the final level of cultivation the mc himself gains immortality around chapter 500600 or even before that im not sure then why the fuckkk r u cultivating for, oh my god it makes no sense. his resolves makes no sense and r just nonsense now how do u feel after reading that sentence, now imagine an entire book filled with such shit.now for the next part everywhere this mc goes he either has a huge profit or gets a new legacy or something similar stroke of fortune like wtf...how lucky can someone be.it starts to get in ur head after some point , he has no emotion for his dead wife at all or his daughter or a disciple that he accepted and has completely forgotten about , wherever he goes good things happen to him, its just so frustrating, enemities are shallow , every organisation he joins bans infighting, and whats worse the writer doesnt even tell how he gets those siper amazing insights on dao like every other day...the writer just says he went into seclusion and gained insights,as of the rest of the cultivation universe goes into seclusion and masturbates .so my point is this book is for novice readers who have yet to read any xianxia or wuxia books so that they dont notice exactly how bad the book is.also renegade immortalthis bookrenegade immortal is the real masterpiece even though its the first book by er gen."
reviews Desolate Era.txt,"I cannot grasp why so people like this or recommend this. The author just gives everything on a silver platter to this MC. Dropped at book 3 chapter 12. Spoilers ahead from first 3 books.MC died on earth as a teenager from a sickness. Because he was smart he was able accumulate a lot of money which he gave away to kids (charity). Because he did that he was able to meet the lord of death or w/e after dying where the dude said he was first to meet him in billion years. What? Author wants to bullshit his way out of this - like nobody ever donated money to kids - so lets try to ignore this. Anyway he was supposed to be sent to heaven (upper realm) for reincarnation but he got sent to mortal real with an overpowered visualization technique from ""Nuwa painting"" that would be super strong in heaven realm and his memories intact.He gets reborn as a ""smart"" child that isnt able to cultivate - standard. But in a short few chapters we know its all bullshit and he is just an perfect example of a MC with an insane plot armor.He is too overpowered at everything. He is born in a family with the strongest father (the strongest in the area that uses the strongest defensive sword style - which of course MC learns). His mother is a woman with a mysterious background that knows the best movement technique that only he and his father know (later on after he masters that she gives him an overpowered movement technique from the heavenly realm - ok then). Because he was ""visualizing the painting"" since he was born he was able to train his soul and split it to dual wield 2 swords and use 2 different sword techniques at the same time. One best defensive sword technique his father uses and the other super offensive technique (that is super strong but is damaged so it will clearly only grow in power in the future when he completes it). He is able to achieve super duper legendary awakening result while starting to cultivate a body refining technique (that is also the strongest technique in the lands - described as being able to fight with 100 opponents of the same strengths - ok then ). He is able to get a damaged magic tool (3 swords) for nothing - swords that are better than his fathers and so far we know the best in the area. He mastered bows from the strongest bow expert and he can kill humans without remorse the first time he fights them. He mows downs every enemy like grass. Theres a moment when somebody close to him dies and he goes on a revenge spree only to leave a small child from the enemy family alive because ""he has his own morals"" or something when everybody around him told him to finish him because he will be trouble in the future. Even the author acknowledges that in the next few lines saying that the family will train that child to kill the MC. Very ""Smart"" MC. Then he goes outside to train only to find some kind OP ""dragon like"" opponent that ""respects his strength"". Only to help it escape when some experts tried to ambush it. Why did they want to ambush it? Because they could tame it and make it evolve into a super duper crazy dragon. Oh wow the dragon that respects MC strength and owes the MC for helping him can be tamed and evolved into OP dragon, I DO WONDER WHERE THIS IS GOING. Either way. The MC then runs from the strong expert only to ... hold my beer because i wouldnt have the balls to write this myself ... run till he finds a pond where he sees the moon reflection and he ponders the dao (while of course still being hunted) - something that only higher level experts can do. And when the expert catches to him he uses the new skill he gained to summon a super duper strong lotus projection to attack him. But fear not because author decided that all the stuff so far wasnt OP enough so of course because the MC knows how to ""split his soul"" in two parts he summons not one but 2 OP lotus projections to grind the expert between them. This is just insane how much of a plot armor can 1 character have. Maybe some people like it when MC gets a free handout from the author and has an easy ride but i prefer my MCs to work hard for their skills and abilities. Current status for me: perma dropped till i read every other novel on the site and this is the only thing left ... only to read ROMJ again.","i read this a few years ago while they were still updating the site yes before they had the app with the newest chapters because there was still so much left to add on before the translation and posting was finished. it is one of the big 4 for me that really sunk me into wuxia and wuxiaworld in general! out of everything ive read. this is one of the best. and its written in such a way that you go along and get lost in the amazing place that was created and get lost in the people in it! if you read carefully with this one and a couple others, you may find that if they are driven by their heart or cold emotionless intelligence, they end up in different situations so please remember how to take a grain of salt, but still enjoy. no matter your dao strive forward to be the best you that you can be! because no one else can be you. thats one big thing you find with these books. they are an amazing fantasy world to get lost in. but its written in such a way that if you take the time to think about some things that happen in it you may find you learned something. even about yourself. ah! off on tangent. great book and i will always reread it. it will always be worth the time."
reviews Desolate Era.txt,So Fare great I've only read a bit but I'm digging it. The action is top grade. The fights unbelievable. Non stop. The drama and villains are engaging.

Can't wait to finish it. I've read quite a few and this one is absolutely one of the best I've read. I really enjoy it. Captured my attention like few other novels have. I can only say IMPRESSIVE.,i truly enjoyed the novel. it was my second novel to read by iet. i tried coiling dragon twice but gave up early but this novel was truly a gem. i feel like better translationediting could upgrade the value of this novel even higher.i will briefly list what i enjoyed the most. might be spoilers for certain people but might help the people who are hesitant to begin.1. no harem2. new path of cultivation3. no 10chapter long tribulations4. no you court death young masters5. op characters act like op6. mcs plot armor is unlike other mcs u dont basically feel like theres one lol

You have found an awesome novel to read!Enjoy ;-)Other novels I also rank very highly, just as this one, are these:- I shall seal the heavens- Renegade Immortal- Stellar Transformation- Warlock of the Magus World","i really love this novel. i was addicted to it. glued in front of my phone non stopthis is not a typical novel like any others.the flow, character and everything in this novel is breathtaking.the family relationship between the characters, whether hate  revenge love familial piety, all of them were as if the ground floor of your apartment.if they are removed, a nagging feeling penetrates into the cheat and the whole building comes crashing downa bit exaggerated but yeah, just imagine.especially on the part where the mc is not every time powerful. sometimes he lose also but that single loses keep him coming back stronger.take your time to read it and im sure you are gonna love it."
reviews Desolate Era.txt,"a great book to read and is interesting throughout the story. the main character is never way to overpowered that it is boring and their is never the same thing happening over and over. Desolate Era is the book that really got me into the whole wuxia genre and i have not been able to stop reading the genre since. No matter how many books i read Desolate Era is still one of my number one favorites. it is a great book to try out the genre. One thing i really like is how even though the MC meets new characters, he never forgets the old ones unlike some books.","spoliersi liked the vast majority of this book, but then the author just fucked near the end. you watch the marathon of the mc adventure and the suspense and the drama and you follow it. then the author takes a baseball bat to his knees and makes him fail. book 39 and everything after it is just outright depressing. all so that the authors next book can be about a side character that was mentioned only in the first handful of chapters. i will never read another iet authored novel. honestly this disappointed me so much im considering dropping my vip since i only use it to read books. the chinese are such terrible authors. theyre in love with bad endings and tropes. i dont know whats more depressing russian authors or chinese authors."

reviews A Will Eternal.txt,"I have read many many MANY novels on WXW and other websites. And this one stands out the most to me. Heck, this is the first novel Iâm reading for the second time.The reason why this novel is so memorable is that it is so different from your usual xianxia novel. The MC and support cast are great and really fleshed out. Well actually... the MC can be a bit polarizing. I sometimes find myself not knowing whether to laugh or cry at the MC. Heâs not your regular OP kick as MC, but a stupid brilliant idiot at times. In the beginning I was a bit put off by his quirkyness. But later on, I grew fond of it and was lmao-ing hard at times in public (looking just as idiotic as the MC).The author is able to deliver so much in terms of humor. Seems like ISSTH served as a basis for this novel and for this one, the author decided to go all out on humor. Which I really appreciate.The support cast is great as well. Rarely felt left out or put aside when MC powers up. Their interaction makes this novel feel really fleshed out.In terms of humor and character interaction, definitely among the best. World building, fights and suspense is great as well.Definitely a highly recommend from me. However, I do suggest reading other mainstream novels before starting this one, as this one is quite different from the rest.","i have read many many many novels on wxw and other websites. and this one stands out the most to me. heck, this is the first novel im reading for the second time.the reason why this novel is so memorable is that it is so different from your usual xianxia novel. the mc and support cast are great and really fleshed out. well actually... the mc can be a bit polarizing. i sometimes find myself not knowing whether to laugh or cry at the mc. hes not your regular op kick as mc, but a stupid brilliant idiot at times. in the beginning i was a bit put off by his quirkyness. but later on, i grew fond of it and was lmaoing hard at times in public looking just as idiotic as the mc.the author is able to deliver so much in terms of humor. seems like issth served as a basis for this novel and for this one, the author decided to go all out on humor. which i really appreciate.the support cast is great as well. rarely felt left out or put aside when mc powers up. their interaction makes this novel feel really fleshed out.in terms of humor and character interaction, definitely among the best. world building, fights and suspense is great as well.definitely a highly recommend from me. however, i do suggest reading other mainstream novels before starting this one, as this one is quite different from the rest."
reviews A Will Eternal.txt,"My rating: 7/10This story is a bout a kid who's lost his parents that manages to step into the world of cultivation. His greatest strength (and weakness) lies in his talent for pill Dao which he will use to help forge his path forwards. He is a troubled young kid due to the fact that he lost his parents at an early age, something that caused him to develop PTSD. He deals with it by trying to make friends and be happy but at first is unsuccessful. He will manage to defeat his trauma over time by making good friends and through hard work. He is obsessed by the Pill Dao, so much so that he does a little more damage with it than good.The story is pretty good. It has the typical things wuxia novels have: a need to get stronger, entering a sect, cultivating, tournaments, pill concoction, going through dangerous places/dungeons/realms, encountering/making dangerous enemies. The cycle repeats for most of the novel. The thing that sets this novel apart is that its written well and the biggest + goes to that fact that there's plenty of comedy in it. And you will laugh because there's a lot of funny stuff.The Main Character(MC) is a bit dumb, makes questionable decisions, gives dumb names to things(really dumb names), always manages to mess up when concocting pills but the way he does it is silly and always gets a laugh. This is without a doubt the greatest strength of this novel and it's done very well.The side characters are pretty bland with the exception of a few (which are good). The world is large and interesting although it's not focused on so much and the factions are typical. (Btw, if you read I Shall Seal The Heavens you will get a ""Woooah!"" moment or two.)Overall its a good novel with lots of laughs and i do recommend it!","my rating 710this story is a bout a kid whos lost his parents that manages to step into the world of cultivation. his greatest strength and weakness lies in his talent for pill dao which he will use to help forge his path forwards. he is a troubled young kid due to the fact that he lost his parents at an early age, something that caused him to develop ptsd. he deals with it by trying to make friends and be happy but at first is unsuccessful. he will manage to defeat his trauma over time by making good friends and through hard work. he is obsessed by the pill dao, so much so that he does a little more damage with it than good.the story is pretty good. it has the typical things wuxia novels have a need to get stronger, entering a sect, cultivating, tournaments, pill concoction, going through dangerous placesdungeonsrealms, encounteringmaking dangerous enemies. the cycle repeats for most of the novel. the thing that sets this novel apart is that its written well and the biggest  goes to that fact that theres plenty of comedy in it. and you will laugh because theres a lot of funny stuff.the main charactermc is a bit dumb, makes questionable decisions, gives dumb names to thingsreally dumb names, always manages to mess up when concocting pills but the way he does it is silly and always gets a laugh. this is without a doubt the greatest strength of this novel and its done very well.the side characters are pretty bland with the exception of a few which are good. the world is large and interesting although its not focused on so much and the factions are typical. btw, if you read i shall seal the heavens you will get a woooah! moment or two.overall its a good novel with lots of laughs and i do recommend it!"

reviews A Will Eternal.txt,"A hilarious xianxia light novel that manages to have an excellent and intriguing plot despite having a focus on comedy.This story comes as a breath of fresh air, in that this main character isn't a struggler that has to fight through constant betrayal and treachery, but a silk-pants chosen of the sect who is favoured by the heavens. Many of the jokes in the story target cliches in the xianxia genre, making them particularly amusing to anyone which has read other xianxia novels (particularly I Shall Seal The Heavens and Renegade Immortal).A Will Eternal also supports an excellent cast of recurring characters, each with their own personalities which develop and have a good level of depth. How they relate to each other, and how the main character interacts with them can often be as heartwarming as it is hilarious, resulting in it being very easy to become attached to each and everyone of them.Ultimately, A Will Eternal is a journey that will pull the reader along with it, and if you're like me, you'll end up enjoying every moment of it.","a hilarious xianxia light novel that manages to have an excellent and intriguing plot despite having a focus on comedy.this story comes as a breath of fresh air, in that this main character isnt a struggler that has to fight through constant betrayal and treachery, but a silkpants chosen of the sect who is favoured by the heavens. many of the jokes in the story target cliches in the xianxia genre, making them particularly amusing to anyone which has read other xianxia novels particularly i shall seal the heavens and renegade immortal.a will eternal also supports an excellent cast of recurring characters, each with their own personalities which develop and have a good level of depth. how they relate to each other, and how the main character interacts with them can often be as heartwarming as it is hilarious, resulting in it being very easy to become attached to each and everyone of them.ultimately, a will eternal is a journey that will pull the reader along with it, and if youre like me, youll end up enjoying every moment of it."

reviews A Will Eternal.txt,"One of my favorite novels. Probably in my top 3 and also probably the only harem novel that I would put up with because I love the MC so much.Story starts out really strong from chapter 1, and continues being pretty strong up until the 500s. Then there's a clear decline, as pacing gets much faster and it feels like the story is rushed even though Er Gen said it was his plan to finish it early. That being said even the declining second half I would say is much better than several of the novels out there. And by declining I mean the story gets slightly repetitive, certain tropes are re-used and MC starts to blow through cultivation stages. That being said still pretty humorous and interesting. I also really liked the last 10-20 chapters and how the story ended.I would recommend EVERYONE read this masterpiece. If not for any other reason do it for the comedy. I wish I could forget this novel so I could read it again because the sheer amount of times where I was laughing non-stop makes me miss reading this novel every day. To this day I haven't found a replacement in my daily reading as this is the funniest novel I have ever read, and a very interesting read.Deathblade is also a great translator, who is not only consistent but also very thorough and detailed in his translations making the translation top quality.","one of my favorite novels. probably in my top 3 and also probably the only harem novel that i would put up with because i love the mc so much.story starts out really strong from chapter 1, and continues being pretty strong up until the 500s. then theres a clear decline, as pacing gets much faster and it feels like the story is rushed even though er gen said it was his plan to finish it early. that being said even the declining second half i would say is much better than several of the novels out there. and by declining i mean the story gets slightly repetitive, certain tropes are reused and mc starts to blow through cultivation stages. that being said still pretty humorous and interesting. i also really liked the last 1020 chapters and how the story ended.i would recommend everyone read this masterpiece. if not for any other reason do it for the comedy. i wish i could forget this novel so i could read it again because the sheer amount of times where i was laughing nonstop makes me miss reading this novel every day. to this day i havent found a replacement in my daily reading as this is the funniest novel i have ever read, and a very interesting read.deathblade is also a great translator, who is not only consistent but also very thorough and detailed in his translations making the translation top quality."

As usual in Er Gen novels, the world and characters of the story even outside of the MC Bai Xiaochun are well crafted and memorable, however what really makes this story exceptional is the MC, whose whimsical and trouble-provoking personality is hilariously fun to read about. The MC's reason for cultivating is relatable yet laughable and different to other cultivation novels.

reviews A Will Eternal.txt,"This book has an excellent story. Most complaints are about the MC's character's traits. That complaint, however, is purely subjective.  This is a story about Will (of course) and preservation. The strength to maintain your values from start to finish. If you read this novel you'll notice that no matter how much the MC changes his main values remain intact. Although this novel is a Xianxia, most of its Xianxia elements are slightly diluted by the lighthearted atmosphere that the novel has. But this is what differentiates this novel from others. The bottom line is that this novel will not disappoint you (I hope) so read it.","this book has an excellent story. most complaints are about the mcs characters traits. that complaint, however, is purely subjective.  this is a story about will of course and preservation. the strength to maintain your values from start to finish. if you read this novel youll notice that no matter how much the mc changes his main values remain intact. although this novel is a xianxia, most of its xianxia elements are slightly diluted by the lighthearted atmosphere that the novel has. but this is what differentiates this novel from others. the bottom line is that this novel will not disappoint you i hope so read it."
reviews A Will Eternal.txt,"This novel is great. This one of the few novels I have actually completed and stands up there. I think the story is great and they are plenty of moments that can hype up the story, which is the main way for me to get interested. But the best part is probably the character of Bai Xiaochun, who is extremely relatable and if you are bored of the classic hero personality then this is perfect for you. I think another great part of the novel is the story of him going from basically rag to riches. Itâs a great Er Gen novel and can last you a long time.","this novel is great. this one of the few novels i have actually completed and stands up there. i think the story is great and they are plenty of moments that can hype up the story, which is the main way for me to get interested. but the best part is probably the character of bai xiaochun, who is extremely relatable and if you are bored of the classic hero personality then this is perfect for you. i think another great part of the novel is the story of him going from basically rag to riches. its a great er gen novel and can last you a long time."

reviews A Will Eternal.txt,"AWE is a must read. Bai Xiaochun's exploits are humorous, and made me laugh quite a few times. Although it's overdone sometimes, Er Gen sometimes balances it out with more serious elements, allowing us to see his serious side. It's different enough from most cultivation novels to make it worth your time. I would suggest reading it early on, especially as one of your first books here.Like I said, though the humor is dragged on a little too much, and sometimes you can't help but wish Bai Xiaochun were more serious. And sometimes the plot grows stale. But the bright spots in the novel make it worth it all.","awe is a must read. bai xiaochuns exploits are humorous, and made me laugh quite a few times. although its overdone sometimes, er gen sometimes balances it out with more serious elements, allowing us to see his serious side. its different enough from most cultivation novels to make it worth your time. i would suggest reading it early on, especially as one of your first books here.like i said, though the humor is dragged on a little too much, and sometimes you cant help but wish bai xiaochun were more serious. and sometimes the plot grows stale. but the bright spots in the novel make it worth it all."

I also watch a lot of sit-coms like: The Office, Parks and Rec, Friends, 70s Show, etc. AWE is sort of a blend of the two, so Bai Xiaochun is my all time favorite cultivator.","dear lord, when i found it was like the good ol heavens, and much of it after dropping for second time issth. a good escape.then there was humour nonstop, to the point where it was interfering with the actualy authenticity of the novel itself . power levels get bad as all of er gens novels, eek, contradictions nonstop arent something he even cares for to remove as a bad habit which persists even in a world worht protecting, so its still disappointment and sadness, oh oh.harem, and well, for er gens first harem, was done well. very, very well for a first. pd end was beautiful, those tears on boo where nothing but an assurance that they finally fucked like animals in cage without restraint, and got together.ehem, so final battle, as in issth, is much of an outofnowhere crazy shit stuff never to be cleared up, means much fun, yay.well, it was times times times so much be timestter that issth, phew. by far."
reviews A Will Eternal.txt,9/10.- Funny (depends on your sense of humor. I found it very funny)- World is well-developed. Typical Xianxia but very diverse and complex.- It ends in a Harem. Can't say more cause I will be spoiling too much. But don't worry too much about it.- The MC is an absolute unit.- MC has very unique powers and abilities. Definitely one of the things I liked the most.- Memorable Side characters. Most of the humor lies in the interaction (and misunderstanding lol) between MC and the other characters. Especially the women.-Very well translated and good grammar.-Doesnt drag the story for too long. There is a good ending.Final words- A masterpiece. The standard to which I judge other Chinese Xianxia and Wuxia novels.(The only reason why I deducted a point is because of a certain waifu which I liked very much. I can't say more without spoiling but let me just mention that something about her plot-line was done off-screen and I wanted more. It's a very trivial reason and it may as well be 10/10 if you don't care for that girl at all.),bai xiaochun is quite unique compare to various main charactershero and different from ive read before.  his antics is quite humorous and very down to earth. all i can say this novel is the funniest and enjoyable to read.  cant wait to read the next chapter and see how will his character develop.what i dont understand now is what merit his parents has to make elder li owns them. another thing is why his fear of death when learning martial arts to strengthen himself.er gen is a great writer and a big fan of i shall seal the heavens. good work.

Just finish read the first 100 chapter and can't wait the explore further. Hope to find more funny things, more hilarious accidental achievement and yet also some serious plot. Hope to find the ending not so so just like other novels I've read. Hope to be surprised until the end",this is the best... might not be your average martial path dao cultivation novel but rather a eternal life one... i mean cultivation is for eternal life....anyways the mc is amazing i love how er gen can stabilize the mcs development and characteristic...its completely amazing dont forget the comedy and also the fact its not always happygomerry. seriously just try it alchemy in awe is amazing as a novicenovel reader i am absolutely positive that this is one of the best novels no doubt.well the story is one thing i also like the fact that this is so nicely translated props to deathblade im gonna probably try issth next peace

BX is definitely one of the most unique MC, not your generic ones that are cool/aloof/amazing etc etc.I definitely recommend it, so everyone please be patient and sit for a long yet fun journey!!!!!PS: Have I mentioned that BX is a poser? And a perfectly believable one at that? And a genius too?"," hilarious funny protagonist not too op, every fight he win have a reason great world building system if you are a fan of old work of er gen  very recommend . there is many gimmick from old work eg. i shall seal the heaven you will like. how do i write more than 100 words with this? lol every side character have a good characteristics. hilarious again. lol this is the most good point of this work. you wont find any wuxiaxianxia novel this funny out there. thank you for reading "
reviews A Will Eternal.txt,"This is a solid novel, shorter than some of the others he wrote but filled with a lot more comedy. The journey is still filled with good life and death battles and the main character does not have an easy super power to get out every time. Much like ISSH it is a struggle; however, there is a lot more silliness with character relations and how the MC thinks. Also translated by one of the best and most trusted translators brings the best English experience. I started this years ago and i can still remember some of the goofy events that the MC rushes into.","while a will eternal by ergen is an enjoyable read, there were a few aspects of the novel that fell short for me. firstly, some of the characters felt underdeveloped and onedimensional, which made it difficult to become fully invested in their journeys. additionally, the story does rely on some common tropes of the cultivation genre, which can make some plot points feel predictable.another issue i had with the book was the pacing. while the overall pacing was well done, there were times when the story felt rushed, particularly towards the end. some plot points and character arcs could have been given more time to develop, which would have made the ending feel more satisfying.finally, while the humor in the book is welldone, it may not appeal to all readers. some of the jokes and antics may come across as juvenile or crass, which could be a turnoff for some.overall, a will eternal is a solid read, but it does have its flaws. while the worldbuilding and main character are strong, some of the supporting characters fall short, and the story does rely on some common genre tropes. the pacing can also feel rushed at times, and the humor may not appeal to all readers. despite these issues, however, the book is still an enjoyable read for fans of the genre, and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and engaging adventure story."

reviews A Will Eternal.txt,"While ""A Will Eternal"" by Ergen is an enjoyable read, there were a few aspects of the novel that fell short for me. Firstly, some of the characters felt underdeveloped and one-dimensional, which made it difficult to become fully invested in their journeys. Additionally, the story does rely on some common tropes of the cultivation genre, which can make some plot points feel predictable.Another issue I had with the book was the pacing. While the overall pacing was well done, there were times when the story felt rushed, particularly towards the end.

Like seriously if youre afraid of death then just cultivate silently and stop your blabbing and flaunting  Unless you like arrogant young masters for some reason then dont read this.","main character is horrible. 300 chapters in and after dozens of years of cultivating, hes still immature like a kid. all he cares about is showing off and getting praised even when he didnt do anything. evert time something he does messes up, he feels wronged that others want to attack him and get revenge while saying theyre bullies. he never gets any character development or grows more mature. i honestly dont know how so  many people could enjoy this and make it overwhelmingly recommended. i dont recommend it unless you enjoy a mc who just likes showing off for no reason and is an immature kid."
reviews A Will Eternal.txt,"Reasons to not read:1) Rampant sexism. Every single woman of any note is ""shockingly beautiful,"" and every chapter that they show up in will include a mention of the fact that the main character thinks they're hot. With maybe three exceptions, the only times women are described as anything other than super hot, they're ugly and therefore a punchline.2) Homophobia. 410 chapters in and we finally meet the first gay character. He is of course explicitly evil, repeatedly referred to as a sex deviant, and tries to sexually assault the main character the moment they meet. And just to drive the point home, his boss is also an evil gay rapist.","overrated because of authors previous work. this novel story development is really nice and all but when it come to the mc development, its extremely disappointing when you see how even minor side character have better development as compare to mc. this is probably one of the few novel where i honestly think the mc deserve to be fully humiliated. mc does have extreme godplot rng where you think whats the point when he is a goddammit coward that doesnt even dare to do anything besides causing problems left and right. extremely recommended to people that doesnt like mainstream mc and prefer an extremely coward and bragging mc that lived of extreme rng to survive."
reviews A Will Eternal.txt,"This series starts off well but the MC never seems to get any more mature than the average 8 year old. After 300+ chapters, I couldn't take it anymore. review must have a 100 words. OK. the first few chapters try to build the MC has some sort of clever schemer but then stops. The next 300 chapters, the MC either runs away from every problem or brute forces it. So, not much of weasel at all really and more just a dumb dumb who stumble from one fortunate encounter to another. I grew to really hate him and was cheering the rabbit on. That was when I realized I was done with this series.","the beginning is very good but it starts to get boring after afew hundred chapters. i finally gave up at chapter 800, by then it was ridiculously boring and one sided, with nothing interesting to look forward to.i feel most of the positive reviews should be from readers who only read the first few hundred chapters or less, yes its still a good story at the start but by the time u reach 800 chapters u realise how boring, silly, repetitive and ridiculous the story has become.i suggest for u to read a record of a mortals journey to immortality, city of terror, the wandering inn, my girlfriend is a zombie"

reviews The Grandmaster Strategist.txt,"I absolutely love this work. I look back and itâs by far the best Iâve read. The storytelling, background, side figures and strategies are are nothing short of impressive. I absolutely love that Suying is so smart and he acts smart too. In many other novels they might say the mc is smart but you really doubt it because you donât really see it. They either propose unrealistic things or are aided by a system. Suying on the other hand has soundproof strategies and his intelligence is visible in so many situations. And this note I also love the poems. Itâs something really unique and I love it. Also as stated above the side characters are given a lot of screen time. It makes it all seem more realistic. Thatâs really well done. You learn to love every character and they all act reasonable. The villains might hate Suying but are still able to Fontaine it and act logically. If danger approaches they are able to act together and be a threat to even Suying. They make it whole. The only negativ thing to me would be the martial arts part. I know many people love them but I deem them unfit for this kind of realistic novel. I mean there is not much point if one character is as strong as 500 soldiers. But thatâs nothing to stop me from loving it. I think I said enough and I recommend it to everyone who wants to read about a well thought world and a smart mc with political and militaristic features.I forgot to mention that I also love the fantasy/ history background. Because the Yuan dynasty in the novel is obviously  based on the Tang Dynasty. It starts with the name of the reigning family Li, which was their family name and goes on with the name of the emperor Li Zhi was an actual emperor of the dynasty. And they too originated from nomads and were famous for their cavalry. So Iâm finished. Hope you will give grandmaster strategist a shot.","i absolutely love this work. i look back and its by far the best ive read. the storytelling, background, side figures and strategies are are nothing short of impressive. i absolutely love that suying is so smart and he acts smart too. in many other novels they might say the mc is smart but you really doubt it because you dont really see it. they either propose unrealistic things or are aided by a system. suying on the other hand has soundproof strategies and his intelligence is visible in so many situations. and this note i also love the poems. its something really unique and i love it. also as stated above the side characters are given a lot of screen time. it makes it all seem more realistic. thats really well done. you learn to love every character and they all act reasonable. the villains might hate suying but are still able to fontaine it and act logically. if danger approaches they are able to act together and be a threat to even suying. they make it whole. the only negativ thing to me would be the martial arts part. i know many people love them but i deem them unfit for this kind of realistic novel. i mean there is not much point if one character is as strong as 500 soldiers. but thats nothing to stop me from loving it. i think i said enough and i recommend it to everyone who wants to read about a well thought world and a smart mc with political and militaristic features.i forgot to mention that i also love the fantasy history background. because the yuan dynasty in the novel is obviously  based on the tang dynasty. it starts with the name of the reigning family li, which was their family name and goes on with the name of the emperor li zhi was an actual emperor of the dynasty. and they too originated from nomads and were famous for their cavalry. so im finished. hope you will give grandmaster strategist a shot."
reviews The Grandmaster Strategist.txt,"In the sea of the generic and junk ones, it's one of the books that reminds me what a great story and novel looks like. I am still half-way tho. Every chapter is gold and can't bump read and skim through like others or you will lose the way. I recommend anyone who would like to read a great plot without non-sense young masters shaming MC all the times and bullshit treasures which make MC ascend to the god while just by fking around with the jade beauties. Even for one who don't like wuxia, it is great to read for its amazing story. Highly recommended!!!","in the sea of the generic and junk ones, its one of the books that reminds me what a great story and novel looks like. i am still halfway tho. every chapter is gold and cant bump read and skim through like others or you will lose the way. i recommend anyone who would like to read a great plot without nonsense young masters shaming mc all the times and bullshit treasures which make mc ascend to the god while just by fking around with the jade beauties. even for one who dont like wuxia, it is great to read for its amazing story. highly recommended!!!"
reviews The Grandmaster Strategist.txt,"The best series in this site. It has everything: schemes, martial arts, cultivation, strategy, polotics, history, and romance. And the poems! The poems intertwined with historical nuance and background ties the plot too well.The character development is also top notch, the main character grows with each arc. His schemes and plans becomes more detailed and more brilliantly executed as the story progresses.The translation is also excellent. The team did well in translating the poems, the names, and the internal history. The appendices of each chapter is greatly detailed. I look forward to the team doing a new series and I hope Wuxiaworld adds more stories like these.","the best series in this site. it has everything schemes, martial arts, cultivation, strategy, polotics, history, and romance. and the poems! the poems intertwined with historical nuance and background ties the plot too well.the character development is also top notch, the main character grows with each arc. his schemes and plans becomes more detailed and more brilliantly executed as the story progresses.the translation is also excellent. the team did well in translating the poems, the names, and the internal history. the appendices of each chapter is greatly detailed. i look forward to the team doing a new series and i hope wuxiaworld adds more stories like these."

reviews The Grandmaster Strategist.txt,"At first I was dubious at the 100% rating on WWW, which is usually skewed by few reviews, but my god is this novel a masterpiece, well deserving a 10/10. This is my 32nd novel on this site (many more on others), but I certainly say it is one of my favorites. Spent three consecutive days constantly reading this (currently at the latest chapter 217). This novel focuses on strategy and warfare, which is definitely a change of pace for me as my other readings tend towards the more xianxia fantasy sort. I tend to shy away from period pieces, but this had me hooked.The writing is masterful, and the footnotes, MY GOD, Iâm so happy to see them. Really helps capture the essence of the language (though ideally read in the native language). Iâm technically bilingual in Chinese and English, but am not good enough to fully appreciate the beautiful idioms and poems. I bow down to the author and translator for their hard work. Chapters are long and very informative and requires careful reading, I recommend not skimming through as sometimes the text is rather heavy.I would note that readers will have to endure the political rhetoric of Ancient China courts, the sophistry, bootlicking, and excessive humbleness at some points can be a tiring read; but it really do be like that in Ancient China.The one major ick I have is the rather blatant sexist views people in the novel have against women. I get that it conforms to the worldview of the setting, but doesnât mean Iâm happy about it.","at first i was dubious at the 100 rating on www, which is usually skewed by few reviews, but my god is this novel a masterpiece, well deserving a 1010. this is my 32nd novel on this site many more on others, but i certainly say it is one of my favorites. spent three consecutive days constantly reading this currently at the latest chapter 217. this novel focuses on strategy and warfare, which is definitely a change of pace for me as my other readings tend towards the more xianxia fantasy sort. i tend to shy away from period pieces, but this had me hooked.the writing is masterful, and the footnotes, my god, im so happy to see them. really helps capture the essence of the language though ideally read in the native language. im technically bilingual in chinese and english, but am not good enough to fully appreciate the beautiful idioms and poems. i bow down to the author and translator for their hard work. chapters are long and very informative and requires careful reading, i recommend not skimming through as sometimes the text is rather heavy.i would note that readers will have to endure the political rhetoric of ancient china courts, the sophistry, bootlicking, and excessive humbleness at some points can be a tiring read but it really do be like that in ancient china.the one major ick i have is the rather blatant sexist views people in the novel have against women. i get that it conforms to the worldview of the setting, but doesnt mean im happy about it."
reviews The Grandmaster Strategist.txt,"A delight to work through. The chapters dense and frequently use poetry, but the translators have done an excellent job bringing context and providing clear translations for what surely is a herculean task. A truly solid Wuxia series with crafty scheming, frequent political intrigue, epic battles, all while clearly carrying the reader in their journey through the story. The Dramatis PersonÃ¦ (basically a character glossary) has been quite helpful in remembering the numerous side characters that come back and add depth to the story. The chapters are long and dense with story telling (hence the longer release times for each one), but are thoroughly worth the wait as new elements emerge and previous schemes are addressed. Strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a more classical wuxia series or just anyone that enjoys court politics with excellent writing.","a delight to work through. the chapters dense and frequently use poetry, but the translators have done an excellent job bringing context and providing clear translations for what surely is a herculean task. a truly solid wuxia series with crafty scheming, frequent political intrigue, epic battles, all while clearly carrying the reader in their journey through the story. the dramatis person basically a character glossary has been quite helpful in remembering the numerous side characters that come back and add depth to the story. the chapters are long and dense with story telling hence the longer release times for each one, but are thoroughly worth the wait as new elements emerge and previous schemes are addressed. strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a more classical wuxia series or just anyone that enjoys court politics with excellent writing."
reviews The Grandmaster Strategist.txt,"Easily one of the most intriguing stories on WW. Historical military and political intrigue at its finest.  Add in the surprisingly deep characters, brief chapter introductions and consistent motives of the characters and itâs a solid 11/10. Furthermore the translation quality is great and thereâs never a moment where things push the reader out of the story.  Even if your here for the cultivation power trip novels, give this one a shot, the quality is worth it and it has a meaningful story to tell the reader. Beware of accidentally losing track of time when you pick up this novel though.","easily one of the most intriguing stories on ww. historical military and political intrigue at its finest.  add in the surprisingly deep characters, brief chapter introductions and consistent motives of the characters and its a solid 1110. furthermore the translation quality is great and theres never a moment where things push the reader out of the story.  even if your here for the cultivation power trip novels, give this one a shot, the quality is worth it and it has a meaningful story to tell the reader. beware of accidentally losing track of time when you pick up this novel though."

Translator and editors have done amazing work.As for the story, it was a change of pace compared to everything else Iâd read here. And I loved it. It was fresh and exciting! The story was extremely well thought out and the MC had no tools but his own intelligence. There wasnât useless information every other line or stupid characters placed there only to provide a villain/challenge. The rating on this story is well deserved.I canât wait for it to finish so I can dive back in and complete the story.","read this a while ago and eventually caught up to where it was at. definitely the best translated story ive read on ww. translator and editors have done amazing work.as for the story, it was a change of pace compared to everything else id read here. and i loved it. it was fresh and exciting! the story was extremely well thought out and the mc had no tools but his own intelligence. there wasnt useless information every other line or stupid characters placed there only to provide a villainchallenge. the rating on this story is well deserved.i cant wait for it to finish so i can dive back in and complete the story."

reviews The Grandmaster Strategist.txt,"I would rate this an eight over ten stars.I've enjoyed this novel very much - there is a lot of suspense as well as strategy that the main character comes up with to protect his feeble self. The world building is well thought out as how the main character devises schemes to throw off his enemies as well as recruit new allies.There is a certain element of romance in this story as well. I would say that the romantic parts of the story are well written but it is just enough for the mainstream reader. Overall, I think most readers would enjoy this very much.","i would rate this an eight over ten stars.ive enjoyed this novel very much  there is a lot of suspense as well as strategy that the main character comes up with to protect his feeble self. the world building is well thought out as how the main character devises schemes to throw off his enemies as well as recruit new allies.there is a certain element of romance in this story as well. i would say that the romantic parts of the story are well written but it is just enough for the mainstream reader. overall, i think most readers would enjoy this very much."
reviews The Grandmaster Strategist.txt,"This is a good novel, but I would not say it's one of the best.As everyone has written their shares of they liked within the novel, I'll start off with some things I disliked.Firstly, the romance is difficult to understand. In some sense, it's unrealistic and not developed. I get this book is more focused on scheming than romance, so it's just touched on through the periods of time but it's really not written well. The MC is motivated by love, but the idea of that motivation is difficult to understand. It lacks depth. Goes for both of his love interests.The way he builds up his hidden forces and fortunes is also relatively illogical. The MC is of course intelligent, but for him to literally dominate all other strategists makes the rest of the characters look stupid. Now that doesn't mean there aren't any intelligent characters.  It's just I would like to see more than the author writing ""this character accomplished this and that"" then MC comes in and *wins*.  *Adds in some minor issues.*I guess the best way to say this is that he has plot armor. His right-hand man is a genius in martial arts and by volume 3 can defeat almost top-tier experts.  He's given limited information but still comes up with amazing plans and schemes. Call this his ""talent"" or whatnot, but it falls short to exemplify a realistic plot.The novel itself also went through some changes and I do see myself liking the earlier volumes than the later ones. Starting from volume 4, it starts to get repetitive. There's basically no setbacks for the MC so I don't expect much from the ending.As written below, the translation is really well done. Regardless of what I wrote above, I still found the book decent enough but it's not a masterpiece. I would recommend giving a go at it.7.5/10","this is a good novel, but i would not say its one of the best.as everyone has written their shares of they liked within the novel, ill start off with some things i disliked.firstly, the romance is difficult to understand. in some sense, its unrealistic and not developed. i get this book is more focused on scheming than romance, so its just touched on through the periods of time but its really not written well. the mc is motivated by love, but the idea of that motivation is difficult to understand. it lacks depth. goes for both of his love interests.the way he builds up his hidden forces and fortunes is also relatively illogical. the mc is of course intelligent, but for him to literally dominate all other strategists makes the rest of the characters look stupid. now that doesnt mean there arent any intelligent characters.  its just i would like to see more than the author writing this character accomplished this and that then mc comes in and wins.  adds in some minor issues.i guess the best way to say this is that he has plot armor. his righthand man is a genius in martial arts and by volume 3 can defeat almost toptier experts.  hes given limited information but still comes up with amazing plans and schemes. call this his talent or whatnot, but it falls short to exemplify a realistic plot.the novel itself also went through some changes and i do see myself liking the earlier volumes than the later ones. starting from volume 4, it starts to get repetitive. theres basically no setbacks for the mc so i dont expect much from the ending.as written below, the translation is really well done. regardless of what i wrote above, i still found the book decent enough but its not a masterpiece. i would recommend giving a go at it.7.510"
